    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the error encountered.\n\nThe error `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid endpoint parameters: lowerBound=0.0 initial=-1.0 upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308` indicates that there is an issue with the parameters being passed to the `bracket` method in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`. This suggests that the methods involved in setting up the bounds and the initial values for the solver are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` (Method ID: 15)** - Directly involved in the error, as it is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` (Method ID: 17)** - Another overload of the bracket method that is also involved in the error.\n3. **`AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 14)** - This method calls the bracket method and is responsible for setting up the bounds.\n4. **`FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 13)** - This method is called in the test and is responsible for invoking the inverse cumulative probability logic.\n5. **`FDistributionImpl.getInitialDomain` (Method ID: 0)** - This method is responsible for calculating the initial domain, which could affect the initial value passed to the bracket method.\n6. **`FDistributionImpl.setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 5)** - This method sets the denominator degrees of freedom, which could influence the bounds.\n7. **`FDistributionImpl.setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 4)** - Similar to the previous method, it sets the numerator degrees of freedom.\n8. **`AbstractContinuousDistribution.cumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 6)** - This method is part of the cumulative probability calculation and could indirectly affect the bounds.\n9. **`Beta.regularizedBeta` (Method ID: 7)** - This method is involved in the calculations for cumulative probability and could influence the results.\n10. **`Beta.logBeta` (Method ID: 10)** - While not directly involved in the error, it is part of the broader calculations that could affect the outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
