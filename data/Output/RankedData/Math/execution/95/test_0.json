    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and stack trace, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the operations performed in the test. The test primarily interacts with the `FDistributionImpl` class, specifically its methods for cumulative probability and inverse cumulative probability, as well as the methods for setting degrees of freedom.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **FDistributionImpl:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)** - This method is directly called in the test and is critical for the assertions.\n2. **FDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)** - This method is also directly called in the test and is essential for calculating the probability.\n3. **FDistributionImpl:setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom(D)** - This method is called to set the denominator degrees of freedom, which is part of the test.\n4. **FDistributionImpl:setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom(D)** - Although not called in the test, it is related to the degrees of freedom and could affect the behavior of the cumulative and inverse cumulative probability methods.\n5. **FDistributionImpl:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()** - This method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is relevant to the test.\n6. **FDistributionImpl:getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom()** - Similar to the above, this method retrieves the numerator degrees of freedom.\n7. **AbstractContinuousDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)** - This is a superclass method that may be overridden in `FDistributionImpl` and is relevant to the inverse cumulative probability calculation.\n8. **Gamma:logGamma(D)** - This method is often used in statistical distributions and could be indirectly involved in calculations.\n9. **Beta:regularizedBeta(DDD)** - This method is also commonly used in statistical calculations and may be involved in the cumulative probability calculations.\n10. **Beta:logBeta(DDDI)** - Similar to the above, this method could be involved in the calculations related to the distribution.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the failing test case and their potential impact on the outcome."
