    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the covered methods, we can analyze the methods that are most suspicious in relation to the failing test. The test appears to be related to geometric calculations involving polyhedrons, planes, and vectors. \n\nThe methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure are those that are directly related to the geometric operations being performed in the test. This includes methods related to the creation and manipulation of `Vector3D`, `Plane`, `SubPlane`, and `PolyhedronsSet`. \n\nHere is the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 116,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 117,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 128,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 133,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 182,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 118,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 126,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 127,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **PolyhedronsSet constructor** (ID 116) - This method is crucial as it initializes the polyhedron set with the sub-hyperplanes, which is directly related to the test.\n2. **computeGeometricalProperties** (ID 117) - This method computes properties of the polyhedron, which could be where the failure occurs.\n3. **Plane constructor** (ID 120) - The creation of planes is fundamental in the geometric calculations.\n4. **intersection method** (ID 128) - This method calculates the intersection of planes, which is likely involved in the test.\n5. **SubPlane constructor** (ID 133) - Similar to the Plane constructor, this is essential for creating sub-planes.\n6. **addContribution method** (ID 182) - This method adds contributions to the facets of the polyhedron, which could be a point of failure.\n7. **Plane constructor** (ID 118) - Another constructor for Plane, indicating multiple points of potential failure in plane creation.\n8. **buildNew method** (ID 134) - This method builds a new sub-plane, which is part of the geometric operations.\n9. **toSubSpace method** (ID 126) - This method transforms points to a subspace, which is critical in geometric calculations.\n10. **toSpace method** (ID 127) - Similar to the above, this method transforms points back to space, also critical in the calculations.\n\nThese methods are ranked based on their relevance to the operations being tested and their potential impact on the outcome of the test."
