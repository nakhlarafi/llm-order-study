    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and stack trace, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, as this is the main functionality being tested and the source of the failure.\n\nThe most relevant methods are those in the `FDistribution` class, particularly those related to the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. Additionally, methods that are called during the execution of this method, such as those for cumulative probability calculations, will also be considered suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 43,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 42**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` - Directly related to the test and the source of the failure.\n2. **Method ID 46**: `cumulativeProbability` - This method is likely called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, making it critical to the test's outcome.\n3. **Method ID 45**: Constructor of `FDistribution` - Important for initializing the distribution parameters.\n4. **Method ID 44**: Another version of `inverseCumulativeProbability` - This may be an internal implementation detail that could affect the outcome.\n5. **Method ID 43**: Another internal method related to `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n6. **Method ID 10**: `logGamma` - Used in statistical calculations, potentially relevant to the distribution calculations.\n7. **Method ID 11**: `lanczos` - Related to the gamma function, which is often used in probability distributions.\n8. **Method ID 12**: `regularizedBeta` - Related to beta functions, which may be involved in the calculations.\n9. **Method ID 13**: Another version of `regularizedBeta` - Similar to the previous method, relevant for calculations.\n10. **Method ID 14**: `logBeta` - Also related to beta functions, potentially impacting the calculations.\n\nThese rankings are based on the direct relevance to the failing test and the likelihood of causing inaccuracies in the calculations performed by the `FDistribution` class."
