    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the test and their relevance to the failure.\n\n1. The test `testConstructorTooHigh` is attempting to create an instance of `ElitisticListPopulation` with a population limit of 100 and an elitism rate of 1.25. \n2. The constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` calls the constructor of its superclass `ListPopulation`, which takes an integer parameter for the population limit.\n\nGiven that the test is specifically checking for a condition where the elitism rate is too high (1.25), the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` is directly involved in the failure. The superclass constructor is also relevant, as it is part of the instantiation process.\n\n### Ranking of Methods from Most Suspicious to Least Suspicious:\n\n1. **ElitisticListPopulation Constructor** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is likely where the failure occurs due to the invalid elitism rate.\n2. **ListPopulation Constructor** - This method is called by the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. While it may not be the direct cause of the failure, it is still part of the instantiation process.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
