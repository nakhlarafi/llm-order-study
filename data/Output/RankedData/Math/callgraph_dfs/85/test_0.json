    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the computation leading to the `ConvergenceException`. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is the main method being tested, and it calls several other methods that could potentially lead to the failure.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 26)** - This is the method being tested and is directly responsible for the failure.\n2. **`bracket` (Method ID: 4)** - This method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability` and is responsible for finding the bounds for the root-finding algorithm. It is a likely candidate for causing convergence issues.\n3. **`cumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 10)** - This method is called within the `bracket` method and is essential for determining the cumulative probability, which is critical for the inverse calculation.\n4. **`getDomainLowerBound` (Method ID: 17)** - This method is used to determine the lower bound for the root-finding process, which could affect convergence.\n5. **`getDomainUpperBound` (Method ID: 21)** - Similar to the lower bound, this method determines the upper bound and could also impact convergence.\n6. **`setStandardDeviation` (Method ID: 3)** - This method sets the standard deviation, which is crucial for the normal distribution calculations. If the standard deviation is incorrectly set, it could lead to convergence issues.\n7. **`setMean` (Method ID: 25)** - This method sets the mean of the distribution, which is also critical for the calculations.\n8. **`getInitialDomain` (Method ID: 19)** - This method is used to get the initial guess for the domain, which can affect the convergence of the algorithm.\n9. **`getMean` (Method ID: 9)** - This method retrieves the mean value, which is used in various calculations and could indirectly affect the outcome.\n10. **`getStandardDeviation` (Method ID: 12)** - This method retrieves the standard deviation, which is also important for the calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
