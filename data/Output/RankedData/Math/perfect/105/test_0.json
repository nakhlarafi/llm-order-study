    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test is asserting that the sum of squared errors (SSE) calculated by the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method is non-negative. The failure indicates that this assertion is not being met, which suggests that there may be an issue with the calculation of SSE or the data being added to the regression model.\n\nHere are the methods involved, ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **getSumSquaredErrors()** - This method is directly responsible for calculating the sum of squared errors, which is the value being asserted in the test. If this method is returning a negative value, it is the most suspicious.\n2. **addData(double x, double y)** - This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. If there is an issue with how data is being added (e.g., incorrect calculations of `sumXX`, `sumYY`, or `sumXY`), it could lead to an incorrect SSE.\n3. **<init>()** - The constructor initializes the regression model. While it is less likely to be the source of the problem, if the initial values are set incorrectly, it could affect subsequent calculations.\n\nGiven that there are only three methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the likelihood that each method could be responsible for the failure observed in the test."
