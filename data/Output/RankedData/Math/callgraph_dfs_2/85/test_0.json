    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relevance to the failure.\n\n1. **NormalDistributionImpl:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D** (Method ID: 26) - This is the method directly called in the test and is where the failure occurs. It is highly suspicious as it is the entry point for the test case.\n\n2. **AbstractContinuousDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D** (Method ID: 14) - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `NormalDistributionImpl`. It is also highly relevant to the failure.\n\n3. **UnivariateRealSolverUtils:bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)[D** (Method ID: 4) - This method is involved in the root-finding process and is likely where the convergence issue arises.\n\n4. **NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D** (Method ID: 10) - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is crucial for determining the cumulative probability, which is essential for the inverse calculation.\n\n5. **NormalDistributionImpl:setStandardDeviation(D)V** (Method ID: 3) - The standard deviation is a critical parameter for the normal distribution, and if it is set incorrectly, it could lead to convergence issues.\n\n6. **NormalDistributionImpl:getMean()D** (Method ID: 9) - The mean is another critical parameter for the normal distribution, and its value can affect the results of the calculations.\n\n7. **NormalDistributionImpl:getStandardDeviation()D** (Method ID: 12) - Similar to the mean, the standard deviation's retrieval is important for the calculations in the distribution methods.\n\n8. **MaxIterationsExceededException:<init>(I)V** (Method ID: 11) - This exception is thrown when the maximum number of iterations is exceeded, indicating a potential issue in the iterative process.\n\n9. **ConvergenceException:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)V** (Method ID: 20) - This exception is related to convergence issues, which are directly relevant to the failure.\n\n10. **MathException:<init>(Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V** (Method ID: 8) - This is a general exception that wraps other exceptions, including convergence issues, making it relevant but less suspicious than the others.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
