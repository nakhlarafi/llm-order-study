    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus`. The test is designed to check the behavior of the `parse` method in the `FractionFormat` class when it encounters an invalid input string representing a fraction.\n\nThe most suspicious methods are those that are directly involved in parsing the input string and handling the logic related to fractions. Here\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 3 (`ProperFractionFormat:parse`)**: This method is directly responsible for parsing the fraction input and is the primary suspect since the test fails when parsing an invalid fraction.\n2. **Method ID 0 (`FractionFormat:parse`)**: This method is also involved in parsing and is called by the method above, making it highly relevant to the failure.\n3. **Method ID 13 (`FractionFormat:parse`)**: This method is another parsing method that could be involved in handling the input string.\n4. **Method ID 4 (`FractionFormat:<init>`)**: The constructor initializes the `FractionFormat` object, which is essential for parsing.\n5. **Method ID 1 (`Fraction:reduce`)**: This method is related to reducing fractions, which may be indirectly involved if the parsing logic leads to creating a `Fraction` object.\n6. **Method ID 2 (`MathUtils:gcd`)**: This method is used for calculating the greatest common divisor, which is relevant when reducing fractions.\n7. **Method ID 17 (`MathUtils:sign`)**: This method determines the sign of a number, which could be relevant in the context of fractions.\n8. **Method ID 18 (`FractionFormat:parseAndIgnoreWhitespace`)**: This method handles whitespace in the input, which could affect parsing.\n9. **Method ID 5 (`FractionFormat:getWholeFormat`)**: This method retrieves the whole number format, which is part of the parsing logic.\n10. **Method ID 6 (`FractionFormat:<init>`)**: Similar to Method ID 4, this constructor initializes the `FractionFormat` object and is relevant but less suspicious than the parsing methods. \n\nThe ranking reflects the likelihood of each method contributing to the failure of the test based on their roles in parsing and handling fractions."
