    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test, particularly focusing on methods related to the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability and the continued fraction evaluation.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 19**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly involved in the test and is the primary method being tested.\n2. **Method ID 1**: `evaluate` in `ContinuedFraction` is crucial for the calculations in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n3. **Method ID 26**: `cumulativeProbability` is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it highly relevant.\n4. **Method ID 50**: `getNumericalMean` is used in the calculations of `inverseCumulativeProbability`, affecting the results.\n5. **Method ID 4**: `getSupportUpperBound` is part of the logic in `inverseCumulativeProbability`, influencing the outcome.\n6. **Method ID 17**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is called in the process of calculating the mean, which is relevant to the test.\n7. **Method ID 30**: `getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` is part of the `FDistribution` class and is involved in the calculations.\n8. **Method ID 21**: `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is also part of the `FDistribution` class and is relevant to the calculations.\n9. **Method ID 7**: `getNumericalVariance` is involved in the variance calculations, which can affect the results.\n10. **Method ID 3**: `NoBracketingException` is less directly related but is part of the exception handling in the solver methods, which could be relevant in edge cases."
