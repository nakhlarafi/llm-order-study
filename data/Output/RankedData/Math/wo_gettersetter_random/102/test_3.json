    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test failure and stack trace, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the computation of the chi-square statistic and p-value, as these are the methods that are most likely to be the source of the error.\n\n1. **TestUtils.chiSquare** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. The failure indicates that the expected value does not match the actual value returned by this method.\n2. **ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquare** - This method is called by `TestUtils.chiSquare` and performs the actual calculation of the chi-square statistic. Any issues in the calculation logic here would directly affect the test outcome.\n3. **ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquareTest** - This method is called in the test to compute the chi-square p-value. If there is an issue in how the p-value is calculated, it could also lead to test failures.\n4. **ChiSquareTestImpl.isNonNegative** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative. If it incorrectly identifies negative values, it could lead to incorrect calculations in the chi-square methods.\n5. **ChiSquareTestImpl.isPositive** - Similar to `isNonNegative`, this method checks if the expected values are positive. An error here could also lead to incorrect calculations.\n6. **TestUtils.chiSquareTest** - This method is called in the test to compute the chi-square p-value, and any issues in its implementation could lead to incorrect results.\n7. **GammaDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability** - This method is involved in calculating the cumulative probability for the chi-square distribution, which is part of the p-value calculation.\n8. **Gamma.regularizedGammaP** - This method is used in the calculation of the cumulative probability and could affect the results if there are issues in its implementation.\n9. **ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquareTest** - This method is responsible for the overall chi-square test logic, and any issues here could lead to incorrect results.\n10. **SummaryStatistics** - While not directly involved in the chi-square calculations, any issues in the summary statistics could indirectly affect the results.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranked list of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
