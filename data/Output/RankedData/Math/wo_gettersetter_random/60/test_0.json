    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `testExtremeValues`. The failure is due to a `ConvergenceException` that occurs when evaluating a continued fraction, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the cumulative probability for extreme values are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 20 (ContinuedFraction:evaluate)**: This method is directly involved in the evaluation of the continued fraction, which is where the exception occurs.\n2. **Method ID 1 (NormalDistributionImpl constructor)**: This method initializes the normal distribution, which is crucial for the cumulative probability calculations.\n3. **Method ID 2 (NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability)**: This method computes the cumulative probability, which is the main focus of the test.\n4. **Method ID 6 (Erf:erf)**: The error function is used in the cumulative probability calculation, making it a key player in the failure.\n5. **Method ID 14 (Gamma:regularizedGammaP)**: This method is involved in the gamma function calculations, which are part of the cumulative probability computation.\n6. **Method ID 4 (FastMath:log)**: Logarithmic calculations are often involved in statistical computations, including those in the gamma functions.\n7. **Method ID 3 (Gamma$1:<init>)**: This method is part of the gamma function calculations, which are indirectly related to the failure.\n8. **Method ID 19 (FastMath:exp)**: Exponential calculations are also part of the statistical functions, making this method relevant.\n9. **Method ID 10 (Gamma$1:getB)**: This method is part of the gamma function calculations, contributing to the overall computation.\n10. **Method ID 16 (Gamma:logGamma)**: This method is involved in logarithmic gamma calculations, which are part of the statistical functions.\n\nThe ranking reflects the likelihood that changes or issues in these methods could lead to the observed test failure."
