The ranking is based on their involvement in the failure of the test, the complexity of their logic, and their relevance to the functionality being tested.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be the source of the failure in the test case, considering their roles in the optimization process and the specific assertions made in the test."
