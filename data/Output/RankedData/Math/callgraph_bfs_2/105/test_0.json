    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test, stack trace, and covered methods, we need to analyze the context of the failing test and the methods involved.\n\n1. **getSumSquaredErrors()**: This method is directly involved in the assertion that failed. The test checks if the result of this method is non-negative, and since the assertion failed, it indicates that this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **addData(double x, double y)**: This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. If there is an issue with how data is being processed or stored, it could lead to incorrect calculations in `getSumSquaredErrors()`. Therefore, it is also quite suspicious.\n\n3. **SimpleRegression()**: The constructor initializes the regression model. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, any issues in initialization could potentially lead to problems later on. Thus, it is ranked lower than the other two methods but still suspicious.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there are only three methods covered in the test, the ranking stops here."
