    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test, particularly focusing on methods related to the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, which is the core functionality being tested.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 19**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly related to the failing test, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 26**: `cumulativeProbability` is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it highly relevant.\n3. **Method ID 1**: `evaluate` in `ContinuedFraction` is likely involved in the calculations leading to the failure.\n4. **Method ID 17**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is part of the variance calculation, which could affect the results.\n5. **Method ID 50**: `getNumericalMean` is also part of the calculations that could influence the outcome.\n6. **Method ID 4**: `getSupportUpperBound` is relevant for determining the bounds in probability calculations.\n7. **Method ID 21**: `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is part of the F-distribution calculations.\n8. **Method ID 30**: `getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` is similarly important for the F-distribution.\n9. **Method ID 7**: `getNumericalVariance` is involved in variance calculations, which can affect the results.\n10. **Method ID 0**: The constructor for `FDistribution` is foundational but less directly involved in the failure than the other methods."
