    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test is asserting that the sum of squared errors (SSE) is non-negative, and it fails when this condition is not met. \n\nThe covered methods are:\n\n1. `addData(double x, double y)` - This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. It updates several internal state variables that are crucial for calculating the SSE.\n2. `getSumSquaredErrors()` - This method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors based on the internal state variables updated by `addData`.\n3. `SimpleRegression()` - This is the constructor for the `SimpleRegression` class, which initializes the object.\n\nGiven that the test fails at the assertion involving the result of `getSumSquaredErrors()`, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **`getSumSquaredErrors()`** - This method is directly involved in the assertion that fails. If it returns a negative value, it indicates a problem with the calculations based on the data added.\n2. **`addData(double x, double y)`** - This method is responsible for updating the internal state that `getSumSquaredErrors()` relies on. If there is an issue with how data is added, it could lead to incorrect SSE calculations.\n3. **`SimpleRegression()`** - While this method initializes the object, it is less likely to be the source of the failure since it does not perform any calculations or data manipulations.\n\nSince there are only three methods covered in this test, we will rank them accordingly, with the top two being the most suspicious.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the rankings:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
