    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and coverage information, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the failing test.\n\n1. **Method ID 1**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D` - This method is directly called in the test and is where the failure occurs. It is highly suspicious as it is the immediate source of the exception.\n\n2. **Method ID 4**: `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils:bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)[D` - This method is called from the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is involved in the exception. It is also highly suspicious.\n\n3. **Method ID 0**: `org.apache.commons.math.util.ContinuedFraction:evaluate(DDI)D` - This method is part of the evaluation process in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is indirectly related to the failure.\n\n4. **Method ID 2**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:getInitialDomain(D)D` - This method is likely involved in determining the initial domain for the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, making it suspicious.\n\n5. **Method ID 3**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D` - This method is part of the cumulative probability calculations and may influence the behavior of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\n6. **Method ID 5**: `org.apache.commons.math.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDDDI)D` - This method is involved in the calculations related to the beta function, which is used in the distribution calculations.\n\n7. **Method ID 6**: `org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:logGamma(D)D` - This method is related to gamma functions, which are often used in statistical distributions and could be indirectly related to the failure.\n\n8. **Method ID 10**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom(D)V` - This method sets the degrees of freedom and could be related to the parameters being passed to the distribution methods.\n\n9. **Method ID 11**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom(D)V` - Similar to the previous method, this sets the denominator degrees of freedom and could influence the behavior of the distribution methods.\n\n10. **Method ID 12**: `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:<init>(DD)V` - This constructor initializes the distribution and could be related to the parameters being set incorrectly.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
