    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and the likelihood that they could be the source of the failure.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 12**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly called in the test and is the primary method being tested, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 6**: `cumulativeProbability` is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it a key method in the calculation process.\n3. **Method ID 1**: The constructor of `FDistribution` initializes the distribution parameters, which could affect the results of the probability calculations.\n4. **Method ID 3**: `getNumericalMean` is used in the calculations and could influence the outcome of the inverse cumulative probability.\n5. **Method ID 4**: `getNumericalVariance` is also involved in the calculations and could lead to inaccuracies.\n6. **Method ID 5**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is responsible for calculating variance, which is critical for probability distributions.\n7. **Method ID 10**: `regularizedBeta` is part of the calculations in the cumulative probability and could lead to inaccuracies.\n8. **Method ID 9**: Another version of `regularizedBeta`, which is also involved in the calculations.\n9. **Method ID 8**: This method is part of the `regularizedBeta` calculations and could contribute to inaccuracies.\n10. **Method ID 7**: This method is part of the `Beta` calculations and is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure but still involved. \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the failing test and their potential impact on the results."
