    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failure. The test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` thrown in the constructor of the `Base32` class, specifically when checking if the `pad` byte is in the alphabet or whitespace.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of the methods involved:\n\n1. **Base32.<init>(boolean, byte)** - This method is directly called in the test and leads to the failure. It calls another constructor and passes the `pad` value.\n2. **Base32.<init>(int, byte[], boolean, byte)** - This constructor is where the exception is thrown. It checks if the `pad` is in the alphabet or whitespace.\n3. **Base32.isInAlphabet(byte)** - This method is called to check if the `pad` is valid. It is directly related to the failure since it performs the check that leads to the exception.\n4. **BaseNCodec.<init>(int, int, int, int, byte)** - This method is part of the constructor chain but does not directly contribute to the failure.\n5. **Base32.<clinit>()** - This is a static initializer and does not contribute to the failure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- Method ID 2 is the most suspicious as it directly throws the exception.\n- Method ID 1 is next as it is the constructor that leads to the problematic call.\n- Method ID 3 is also suspicious as it performs the check that causes the exception.\n- Method ID 0 and Method ID 4 are less suspicious as they are part of the constructor chain but do not directly contribute to the failure."
