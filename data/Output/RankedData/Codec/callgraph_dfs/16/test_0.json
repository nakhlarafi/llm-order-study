    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failure. The test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` thrown in the constructor of the `Base32` class, specifically when checking if the `pad` byte is in the alphabet or whitespace.\n\nHere are the methods involved in the failure:\n\n1. **Base32.<init>(boolean, byte)** - This method calls another constructor and passes the `pad` byte.\n2. **Base32.<init>(int, byte[], boolean, byte)** - This method checks if the `pad` byte is in the alphabet or whitespace and throws the exception.\n3. **BaseNCodec.<init>(int, int, int, int, byte)** - This is a superclass constructor that is called but does not directly relate to the exception.\n4. **Base32.<clinit>()** - This is a static initializer and does not relate to the exception.\n\nGiven that the exception is directly related to the `pad` byte being checked in the `Base32` constructor, we can rank the methods based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n1. **Base32.<init>(int, byte[], boolean, byte)** - Directly throws the exception.\n2. **Base32.<init>(boolean, byte)** - Calls the constructor that throws the exception.\n3. **BaseNCodec.<init>(int, int, int, int, byte)** - Involved in the call chain but does not throw the exception.\n4. **Base32.<clinit>()** - Not involved in the exception.\n\nSince there are only four methods involved in this failure, we will rank them accordingly and fill the remaining ranks with placeholders.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": -1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": -1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": -1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": -1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": -1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this output, `-1` is used as a placeholder for methods that are not involved in the failure. The ranks are assigned based on the level of suspicion regarding their involvement in the failure."
