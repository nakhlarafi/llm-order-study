The failing test indicates that the `containsNone` method is returning an unexpected result, which suggests that there may be an issue with its implementation.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods based on the provided information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, since there is only one method covered by the test, it is ranked as the most suspicious. If there were more methods involved, we would analyze their relevance to the failing test and the stack trace to provide a more comprehensive ranking."
