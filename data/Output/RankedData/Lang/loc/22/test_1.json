    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of being the source of the failure. The failure occurred in the `getReducedFraction` method, specifically when it was expected to return a certain value but returned a different one. This suggests that the methods involved in the fraction reduction process, particularly those that handle the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the fraction creation, are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **getReducedFraction (ID: 1)**: This method is directly responsible for reducing the fraction and is where the failure occurred. It handles the logic for normalization and GCD calculation, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor (ID: 0)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to compute the GCD. If there is an issue with how GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect fraction reduction.\n3. **Fraction Constructor (ID: 2)**: This method initializes the fraction object. If there are issues with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n4. **getDenominator (ID: 3)**: This method retrieves the denominator of the fraction. If the denominator is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect assertions in the test.\n5. **getNumerator (ID: 4)**: Similar to `getDenominator`, this method retrieves the numerator. While it is less likely to be the source of the failure, it is still relevant to the overall correctness of the fraction object.\n\nThe remaining methods are not included in the ranking as they do not directly contribute to the failure observed in the test case."
