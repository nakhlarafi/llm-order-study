    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and stack trace, we need to analyze the methods that are likely involved in the `StringUtils.containsNone` functionality and any related methods that may be implicated in the failure.\n\nGiven that the test is focused on checking the behavior of `StringUtils.containsNone` with supplementary characters, we should consider methods that are directly related to string manipulation, character handling, and any utility methods that might be called within `containsNone`.\n\nSince the specific methods covered are not provided, I will assume a hypothetical set of methods that could be involved based on typical implementations of string utility functions. Here\u2019s a ranked list of methods that could be suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this JSON output, the `method_id` represents hypothetical methods that could be involved in the failure, and the `rank` indicates their level of suspicion based on their relevance to the test case. The methods are ranked from 1 (most suspicious) to 10 (least suspicious). \n\nPlease replace the `method_id` values with actual method identifiers from your codebase for a more accurate analysis."
