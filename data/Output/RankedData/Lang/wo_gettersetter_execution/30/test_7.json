    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and stack trace, we need to analyze the context of the test and the methods it covers. The test is focused on the `StringUtils.containsNone` method and its interaction with supplementary characters in strings.\n\nGiven that the test is specifically checking for edge cases involving supplementary characters, the methods that are directly involved in string manipulation and character handling will be more suspicious. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods based on the provided information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method IDs are placeholders as the actual method IDs were not provided in the input. The ranking is based on the assumption that methods directly related to `StringUtils.containsNone` and string indexing are more likely to be the source of the failure."
