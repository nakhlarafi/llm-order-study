    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test is primarily focused on the `getReducedFraction` method, which is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases like zero denominators and integer overflow.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that there is an assertion failure related to the expected and actual values of the numerator when dealing with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. This suggests that the logic in the `getReducedFraction` method, particularly how it handles negative values and the edge case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, is likely flawed.\n\nHere are the methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 1 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is where the assertion failure occurs. The logic for handling `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and the reduction of fractions is critical and appears to be the source of the error.\n   \n2. **Method ID 0 (Constructor)**: The constructor initializes the `Fraction` object. If the `getReducedFraction` method is incorrectly calculating the numerator or denominator, it will affect the values passed to this constructor. Thus, it is suspicious but less so than the method directly causing the failure.\n\n3. **Method ID 2 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is used within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, any issues in how it handles edge cases could indirectly affect the results in `getReducedFraction`. \n\nThe remaining methods are not covered in the test and thus are not ranked."
