    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of being the source of the failure.\n\n1. **Method ID 1**: `getReducedFraction(II)Lorg/apache/commons/lang3/math/Fraction;` - This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for reducing fractions. The failure occurred when calling this method, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 0**: `greatestCommonDivisor(II)I` - This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor, which is crucial for reducing fractions. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect results in `getReducedFraction`.\n\n3. **Method ID 2**: `<init>(II)V` - The constructor of the `Fraction` class is called when creating a new `Fraction` object in `getReducedFraction`. If there are issues with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nGiven that the test failure is related to the expected output of the `getReducedFraction` method, the ranking reflects the direct involvement of these methods in the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the rankings:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there are only three methods involved in the test case, the ranking stops here. If there were more methods, they would be ranked accordingly based on their relevance to the failure."
