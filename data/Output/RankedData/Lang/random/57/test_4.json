The test case `testIsAvailableLocale` and other related tests are also failing due to this method. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSince there is only one method covered in the provided information, it is ranked as the most suspicious. If there were more methods involved, they would be ranked accordingly based on their involvement in the stack trace and the nature of the failure."
