    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of being the source of the failure. The failure occurred in the `getReducedFraction` method, specifically when handling the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 1 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is directly involved in the test case that failed. The stack trace indicates that the expected value was `-1073741824`, but the actual value returned was `-2147483648`. This discrepancy suggests that there is a potential issue in how the method handles the reduction of fractions, particularly with edge cases like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\n2. **Method ID 0 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor. If there is an issue with how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the fraction reduction process, making it a strong candidate for the source of the failure.\n\n3. **Method ID 2 (Constructor)**: While this method is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, it is still involved in the creation of the `Fraction` object. If there were issues with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could indirectly contribute to the failure, but it is less suspicious compared to the other two methods. \n\nThe ranking reflects the likelihood of each method being responsible for the failure based on their roles in the test case and the stack trace provided."
