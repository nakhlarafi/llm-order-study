    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of being the source of the failure.\n\n1. **getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is where the failure occurred. The stack trace indicates that the expected value was not equal to the actual value returned by this method, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to reduce the fraction. If there is an issue with how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in `getReducedFraction`.\n\n3. **Fraction constructor (Fraction(int numerator, int denominator))**: This constructor is called when creating a new `Fraction` object in `getReducedFraction`. If there are issues with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could also lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Any other methods that are called within `getReducedFraction` or `greatestCommonDivisor`**: If there are any utility methods or helper methods that are not shown in the provided information but are called within these methods, they could also be suspicious.\n\n5. **Methods related to handling edge cases**: The test case includes edge cases such as zero denominators and extreme values. Any method that handles these cases could be suspicious if they do not handle the edge cases correctly.\n\nGiven the information, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The ranking is based on the direct involvement in the test case and the stack trace. If there were more methods provided, they would be ranked accordingly based on their relevance to the failure."
