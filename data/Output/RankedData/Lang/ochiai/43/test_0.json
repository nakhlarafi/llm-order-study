    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The `OutOfMemoryError` indicates that the application is trying to allocate more memory than is available, which often occurs due to excessive string manipulation or recursion.\n\nThe methods involved in the stack trace are:\n\n1. `appendQuotedString` - This method is directly involved in appending strings and is likely where the excessive memory usage is occurring.\n2. `applyPattern` - This method calls `appendQuotedString` and is responsible for processing the pattern string.\n3. The constructors of `ExtendedMessageFormat` - These methods initialize the object and call `applyPattern`, which indirectly leads to the memory issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause memory issues:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `appendQuotedString` is ranked highest because it is directly responsible for appending strings and is where the memory issue is likely occurring.\n- `applyPattern` is next as it calls `appendQuotedString` and is involved in processing the pattern.\n- The constructor methods are ranked lower as they primarily set up the object and call `applyPattern`, but they are still part of the chain leading to the error.\n- The `next` method is ranked last as it simply increments the index and is less likely to contribute to the memory issue. \n\nNote: Only five methods are provided in the coverage information, hence the ranking stops at five."
