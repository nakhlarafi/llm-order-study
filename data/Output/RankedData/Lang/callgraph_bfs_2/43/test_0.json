    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failure. The `OutOfMemoryError` indicates that the application is trying to allocate more memory than is available, which often happens due to excessive object creation or infinite loops.\n\nThe methods involved in the stack trace are:\n\n1. `appendQuotedString` - This method is responsible for appending quoted strings and is likely where excessive memory usage is occurring, especially if it is called in a loop without proper termination.\n2. `applyPattern` - This method calls `appendQuotedString` and processes the pattern string. If it does not handle certain patterns correctly, it could lead to excessive calls to `appendQuotedString`.\n3. The constructors of `ExtendedMessageFormat` - These methods initialize the object and call `applyPattern`, which could also contribute to the memory issue if the pattern is not handled correctly.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause memory issues:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `appendQuotedString` is ranked highest because it directly manipulates the string and could lead to excessive memory usage.\n- `applyPattern` is next as it orchestrates the calls to `appendQuotedString`.\n- The constructors are ranked lower as they primarily set up the object but could still contribute to the issue if the pattern is problematic.\n- The `next` method is ranked the lowest as it simply increments the position and is less likely to cause memory issues directly."
