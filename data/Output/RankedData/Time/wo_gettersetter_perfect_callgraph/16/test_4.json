The failure indicates that it is likely not handling the default year correctly.\n2. **Method ID 11 (withDefaultYear)**: This method sets the default year for the formatter. If it is not functioning correctly, it could lead to the wrong year being used in the parsing.\n3. **Method ID 15 (requireParser)**: This method retrieves the parser. If the parser is not set correctly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n4. **Method ID 64 (parseInto in NumberFormatter)**: This method is involved in parsing numbers, which could be relevant if the input string is not being parsed correctly.\n5. **Method ID 1 (forPattern)**: This method creates a formatter based on the pattern. If the pattern is not set correctly, it could lead to parsing issues.\n6. **Method ID 2 (createFormatterForPattern)**: Similar to the previous method, if the formatter is not created correctly, it could lead to issues in parsing.\n7. **Method ID 3 (append0)**: This method is involved in building the formatter. If there is an issue in how the formatter is built, it could affect parsing.\n8. **Method ID 4 (appendDayOfWeekShortText)**: While not directly related, it is part of the formatter building process and could indirectly affect parsing.\n9. **Method ID 5 (appendLiteral)**: Similar to the previous methods, it is part of the formatter building process.\n10. **Method ID 6 (CharacterLiteral constructor)**: This method is less likely to be the cause of the issue but is included as part of the formatter's construction process."
