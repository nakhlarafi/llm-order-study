The ranking is based on their relevance to the failure, which indicates a problem with date parsing and the calculation of local dates.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 14 (`parseLocalDateTime`)**: Directly involved in parsing the local date and is critical to the test case.\n2. **Method ID 13 (`parseLocalDate`)**: Also directly involved in parsing local dates, making it highly relevant to the failure.\n3. **Method ID 0 (`computeMillis`)**: Responsible for computing milliseconds, which is essential for date calculations.\n4. **Method ID 40 (`set`)**: This method sets the value of a saved field, which could affect the parsing logic.\n5. **Method ID 19 (`toLocalDate`)**: Converts a LocalDateTime to LocalDate, which is part of the failure context.\n6. **Method ID 21 (`SavedField` constructor)**: Involves saving fields that are used in date parsing, making it relevant.\n7. **Method ID 22 (`getYear`)**: Retrieves the year from a timestamp, which is crucial for date calculations.\n8. **Method ID 25 (`compareReverse`)**: Used for comparing duration fields, which may affect how dates are processed.\n9. **Method ID 33 (`DateTimeParserBucket` constructor)**: Initializes the parser bucket, which is part of the parsing process.\n10. **Method ID 90 (`selectChronology`)**: Selects the chronology for date parsing, which can influence the outcome of the test. \n\nThese rankings reflect the methods' direct involvement in the parsing and calculation of dates, which are at the core of the test failure."
