The constructor being tested is the only method covered in the test, which makes it the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there is only one method covered in the test, it is ranked as the most suspicious. There are no other methods to rank."
