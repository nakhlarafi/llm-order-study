    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious regarding the failure of the test. The exception `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the code is encountering an unexpected property type while reading files information in the `SevenZFile` class.\n\nThe methods that are directly involved in the stack trace and are likely related to the failure are:\n\n1. `readFilesInfo` - This method is responsible for reading the file information and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. `readHeaders` - This method is responsible for reading the headers of the archive, which includes the properties.\n3. `readHeader` - This method is called within `readHeaders` and is likely involved in processing the properties.\n4. `readPackInfo` - This method is involved in reading the pack information, which may include properties.\n5. `readUnpackInfo` - This method is involved in reading unpack information, which may also include properties.\n6. `readSubStreamsInfo` - This method is involved in reading sub-streams information, which may relate to the properties being read.\n7. `writeFilesInfo` - This method is responsible for writing file information, which may be related to the properties being written.\n8. `writeHeader` - This method is responsible for writing the header, which may include properties.\n9. `writePackInfo` - This method is involved in writing pack information, which may include properties.\n10. `writeUnpackInfo` - This method is involved in writing unpack information, which may also include properties.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the issue based on their roles in reading and writing file properties in the SevenZ archive format."
