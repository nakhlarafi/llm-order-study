    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious regarding the failure. The exception `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the issue arises when reading properties from the `SevenZFile` class, specifically in the `readFilesInfo` method.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this failure are those that are involved in reading and processing the file properties. The methods that are directly related to reading file information and properties are:\n\n1. `readFilesInfo` - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is responsible for reading file properties.\n2. `readHeaders` - This method is responsible for reading the headers of the archive, which may include the properties that are causing the issue.\n3. `readSubStreamsInfo` - This method is involved in reading sub-stream information, which could be related to the properties being read.\n4. `readPackInfo` - This method reads pack information, which may also include relevant properties.\n5. `readUnpackInfo` - This method reads unpack information, which could be related to the properties being read.\n6. `readBits` - This method is used to read bits from the data input, which may be involved in interpreting the properties.\n7. `readUint64` - This method reads unsigned 64-bit integers, which may be relevant for reading certain properties.\n8. `readFolder` - This method reads folder information, which may also include properties related to the files.\n9. `readAllOrBits` - This method reads bits and could be involved in determining the properties of the files.\n10. `readFileNames` - This method reads the names of the files, which may also be relevant to the properties being processed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 66,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 83,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure based on their roles in reading and processing the properties of the SevenZ archive."
