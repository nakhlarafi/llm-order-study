The ranking is based on their relevance to the failing test case, which involves compressing empty files and the potential for issues in handling empty streams and files.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 6 (`writeFileEmptyFiles`)**: Directly related to writing empty files, which is crucial for the test case.\n2. **Method ID 5 (`writeFileEmptyStreams`)**: Also directly related to handling empty streams, which is relevant to the test.\n3. **Method ID 11 (`writeFilesInfo`)**: Involves writing file information, including empty files, making it suspicious.\n4. **Method ID 1 (`writeFileMTimes`)**: Handles writing last modified times, which could be affected by empty files.\n5. **Method ID 4 (`closeArchiveEntry`)**: Involves closing entries, which may not handle empty files correctly.\n6. **Method ID 0 (`readFilesInfo`)**: Reads file information, which is essential for understanding how empty files are processed.\n7. **Method ID 3 (`readSubStreamsInfo`)**: Reads sub-stream information, which could be related to empty files.\n8. **Method ID 2 (`readHeaders`)**: Reads headers, which may include information about empty files.\n9. **Method ID 10 (`writeBits`)**: Involves writing bits, which could be related to how empty files are represented.\n10. **Method ID 9 (`readStreamsInfo`)**: Reads stream information, which may indirectly relate to how empty files are handled. \n\nThese rankings are based on the methods' direct involvement with empty files and streams, which are the focus of the failing test case."
