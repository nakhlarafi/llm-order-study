    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the covered methods, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious regarding the failure of the test. The test failed because it expected the value `2` but received `3`. This indicates that the logic responsible for parsing or calculating the integer value is likely flawed.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning for ranking the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 1**: `nextToken()` - This method is directly responsible for fetching the next token from the parser sequence. Since the test failed on the assertion of the integer value, this method is highly suspicious.\n  \n2. **Method ID 3**: `getIntValue()` - This method retrieves the integer value from the current token. Since the test expected `2` but got `3`, this method is also very suspicious as it directly relates to the value being asserted.\n\n3. **Method ID 0**: `JsonParserSequence` constructor - This method initializes the parser sequence. If the sequence is not set up correctly, it could lead to incorrect token parsing.\n\n4. **Method ID 2**: `switchToNext()` - This method is responsible for switching to the next parser in the sequence. If it fails to switch correctly, it could lead to incorrect token retrieval.\n\n5. **Method ID 4**: `_verifyRootSpace()` - This method is involved in ensuring that the root space is correctly parsed. If there is an issue here, it could affect the parsing of numbers.\n\n6. **Method ID 64**: `nextToken()` in `ReaderBasedJsonParser` - This method is also responsible for fetching the next token, but from a specific parser. It could be involved in the incorrect token retrieval.\n\n7. **Method ID 90**: `getIntValue()` in `ParserBase` - Similar to Method ID 3, this method retrieves the integer value and could be a source of the error.\n\n8. **Method ID 100**: `resetInt()` - This method resets the integer parsing state. If it does not reset correctly, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n\n9. **Method ID 96**: `_parsePosNumber()` - This method is responsible for parsing positive numbers. If it incorrectly parses the number, it could lead to the wrong value being returned.\n\n10. **Method ID 14**: `_parseNumber2()` - This method is involved in parsing numbers and could also be a source of the issue if it does not handle the input correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"method_id\": 1, \"rank\": 1},\n    {\"method_id\": 3, \"rank\": 2},\n    {\"method_id\": 0, \"rank\": 3},\n    {\"method_id\": 2, \"rank\": 4},\n    {\"method_id\": 4, \"rank\": 5},\n    {\"method_id\": 64, \"rank\": 6},\n    {\"method_id\": 90, \"rank\": 7},\n    {\"method_id\": 100, \"rank\": 8},\n    {\"method_id\": 96, \"rank\": 9},\n    {\"method_id\": 14, \"rank\": 10}\n]\n```"
