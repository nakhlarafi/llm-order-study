The ranking is based on their involvement in the error reported, which is related to handling surrogate characters in JSON generation.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 20**: Directly involved in the error message regarding split surrogates.\n2. **Method ID 10**: Responsible for writing raw values, which is likely where the surrogate handling is failing.\n3. **Method ID 49**: Related to writing segmented raw characters, which could be involved in the surrogate handling.\n4. **Method ID 40**: Handles outputting surrogates, directly related to the error.\n5. **Method ID 77**: Reports errors, which is crucial in understanding where the failure occurs.\n6. **Method ID 17**: Involved in writing raw characters, which may relate to the surrogate issue.\n7. **Method ID 11**: Related to JSON write context, which may affect how values are written.\n8. **Method ID 1**: Involved in writing values, which could be indirectly related to the error.\n9. **Method ID 4**: Creates generators, which are essential for the writing process.\n10. **Method ID 5**: Contains constants that may be relevant to the handling of characters, including surrogates. \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' proximity to the error and their roles in the JSON generation process."
