    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failing test. The test is focused on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method, which is directly tested through various assertions. The static initializer method (`<clinit>()`) is also relevant as it initializes the `charsetPattern` used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is directly tested and is the primary suspect since the test is failing on its assertions.\n2. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This method initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is crucial for the functionality of `getCharsetFromContentType`. If the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the main method.\n\nSince there are only two methods involved in the test, the ranking will reflect that. Here\u2019s the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
