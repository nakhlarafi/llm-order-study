Since there is only one method involved in the test, it will be ranked as the most suspicious. \n\nHere is the JSON output with the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIn this case, there are no other methods to compare against, so the ranking is straightforward."
