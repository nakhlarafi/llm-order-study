The ranking is based on their relevance to the failing test, which involves parsing HTML and handling character references.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 109,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 95,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 0** (`consumeCharacterReference`): Directly involved in consuming character references, which is central to the test case.\n2. **Method ID 101** (`Tokeniser` constructor): Initializes the tokeniser, which is crucial for parsing.\n3. **Method ID 109** (`characterReferenceError`): Handles errors related to character references, which could be relevant if the test fails due to unrecognized entities.\n4. **Method ID 95** (`consumeLetterSequence`): Consumes sequences of letters, which is part of processing character references.\n5. **Method ID 88** (`current`): Retrieves the current character, which is essential for parsing.\n6. **Method ID 10** (`read`): Reads tokens, which is part of the parsing process.\n7. **Method ID 1** (`Jsoup.parse`): The main entry point for parsing HTML, relevant to the test.\n8. **Method ID 2** (`Parser.parse`): Invoked during the parsing process, relevant to the test.\n9. **Method ID 24** (`HtmlTreeBuilder.parse`): Involved in the parsing logic, relevant to the test.\n10. **Method ID 22** (`TreeBuilder.parse`): Another layer of parsing, relevant to the test.\n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the parsing process and handling of character references, which are critical to the functionality being tested."
