The ranking is based on their involvement in the processing of the DOCTYPE tokens, which is the focus of the failing test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 156,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 0**: Directly processes the DOCTYPE token, making it highly relevant to the test.\n2. **Method ID 4**: Inserts the DocumentType node, which is crucial for the DOCTYPE handling.\n3. **Method ID 5**: Part of the parsing process that would handle the input string, including DOCTYPE.\n4. **Method ID 1**: Resets the DOCTYPE token, which is important for its proper handling.\n5. **Method ID 2**: Constructor for DocumentType, directly related to the creation of DOCTYPE nodes.\n6. **Method ID 3**: Generates the outer HTML representation of the DocumentType, relevant for output.\n7. **Method ID 6**: Initiates the parsing process, which includes handling DOCTYPE.\n8. **Method ID 7**: Related to the tree-building process, which includes DOCTYPE handling.\n9. **Method ID 32**: Processes tokens in the tree builder, including DOCTYPE tokens.\n10. **Method ID 156**: Processes tokens in the XML tree builder, which may also include DOCTYPE handling. \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement with the DOCTYPE processing as indicated by the test case and stack trace."
