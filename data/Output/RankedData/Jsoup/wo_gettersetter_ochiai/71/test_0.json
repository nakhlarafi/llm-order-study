    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The exception indicates that the query 'p:matchText' could not be parsed due to an unexpected token. This suggests that the issue lies within the parsing logic of the query, particularly in the `QueryParser` class.\n\nThe methods that are most suspicious are those related to parsing the query and handling the selectors. Here\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 142,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 143,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 144,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 139,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 158,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 146,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 147,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 148,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 142**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` - This method is directly responsible for parsing the query string, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 143**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` - This method is called after the initial parsing and is crucial for the overall parsing logic.\n3. **Method ID 144**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements()V` - This method is involved in finding elements based on the parsed query, making it relevant to the failure.\n4. **Method ID 140**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - The constructor initializes the parser with the query, which is essential for the parsing process.\n5. **Method ID 141**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:<clinit>()V` - This static initializer may set up patterns used in parsing, which could affect the parsing logic.\n6. **Method ID 139**: `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;` - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the query, linking it to the failure.\n7. **Method ID 158**: `org.jsoup.select.Selector$SelectorParseException:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)V` - This method constructs the exception thrown during parsing, indicating a parsing issue.\n8. **Method ID 146**: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - This method initializes the token queue used for parsing, which is critical for the parsing process.\n9. **Method ID 147**: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:remainingLength()I` - This method checks the remaining length of the queue, which is relevant during parsing.\n10. **Method ID 148**: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` - This method checks for matches in the token queue, which is essential for parsing logic.\n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the parsing process and their potential to cause the observed failure."
