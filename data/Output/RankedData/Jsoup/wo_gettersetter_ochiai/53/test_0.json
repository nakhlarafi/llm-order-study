    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the parsing process that led to the `SelectorParseException`. The exception indicates that there was an issue with parsing the query `div[data='End]'`, specifically an unexpected token at the single quote.\n\nThe methods that are most suspicious are those involved in parsing the selector and handling the attributes. Here\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods based on their involvement in the parsing process:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 137,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 138,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 132,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 133,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 159,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 136 (`QueryParser:parse`)**: This method is directly responsible for parsing the query and is the first point of failure.\n2. **Method ID 137 (`QueryParser:parse`)**: This method handles the actual parsing logic and is where the unexpected token is identified.\n3. **Method ID 140 (`QueryParser:byAttribute`)**: This method is responsible for handling attribute selectors, which is relevant to the test case.\n4. **Method ID 138 (`QueryParser:findElements`)**: This method is involved in finding elements based on the parsed query, including attributes.\n5. **Method ID 134 (`QueryParser.<init>`)**: The constructor initializes the query parser, setting up the context for parsing.\n6. **Method ID 132 (`Selector.<init>`)**: This method initializes the selector, which is the entry point for the selection process.\n7. **Method ID 133 (`Selector:select`)**: This method is responsible for executing the selection based on the query.\n8. **Method ID 159 (`Selector$SelectorParseException.<init>`)**: This method constructs the exception that is thrown when parsing fails, indicating the error context.\n9. **Method ID 1 (`Parser:parse`)**: This method is part of the parsing process but is less directly involved in the selector parsing.\n10. **Method ID 0 (`Jsoup:parse`)**: This is the entry point for parsing HTML, but it is further removed from the specific selector parsing logic. \n\nThese rankings reflect the methods' direct involvement in the parsing process that led to the failure in the test case."
