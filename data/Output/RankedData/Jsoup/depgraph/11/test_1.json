    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the failing test, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious. The exception indicates that there was an issue parsing the query `div:not(.left)`, which suggests that the problem lies within the parsing logic of the `Selector` class.\n\nHere are the top 10 most suspicious methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 4** - `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`\n   - This method is directly involved in selecting elements based on the query string, which is where the failure occurred.\n\n2. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V`\n   - The constructor initializes the `Selector` with the query and root element, which is critical for parsing.\n\n3. **Method ID: 9** - `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;`\n   - This method is responsible for consuming the element selector from the token queue, which is essential for parsing the query.\n\n4. **Method ID: 5** - `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This method validates that the query string is not empty, which is a prerequisite for parsing.\n\n5. **Method ID: 6** - `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - Similar to the previous method, it validates that the query string is not empty with a custom message.\n\n6. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.select.Selector$SelectorParseException:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - This method constructs the exception that is thrown when parsing fails, indicating that it is directly related to the error.\n\n7. **Method ID: 2** - `org.jsoup.select.Selector:<clinit>()V`\n   - This static initializer may set up necessary static fields or configurations that could affect parsing.\n\n8. **Method ID: 3** - `org.jsoup.select.Selector:addElements(Ljava/util/Collection;)V`\n   - While this method adds elements to the selector, it may be indirectly related if the selection logic is flawed.\n\n9. **Method ID: 10** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseAttribute()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;`\n   - This method is involved in parsing attributes, which could be relevant if the query involves attributes.\n\n10. **Method ID: 11** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()V`\n    - This method parses start tags, which is part of the overall parsing process and could be relevant to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranked methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
