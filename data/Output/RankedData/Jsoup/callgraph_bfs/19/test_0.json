    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the test case and the likelihood that they could be causing the failure.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 181,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 188,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 189,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 0 (basicWithImages)**: This method is directly called in the test and is crucial for setting up the whitelist.\n2. **Method ID 1 (basic)**: This method is called by `basicWithImages`, making it essential for the test's setup.\n3. **Method ID 10 (addEnforcedAttribute)**: This method is related to adding attributes to the whitelist, which is critical for the test's functionality.\n4. **Method ID 29 (testValidProtocol)**: This method checks if the protocols are valid, which is directly related to the test's purpose of handling custom protocols.\n5. **Method ID 181 (isSafeAttribute)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is relevant to the test's validation of attributes.\n6. **Method ID 188 (copySafeNodes)**: This method is responsible for copying nodes while checking their safety, which is relevant to the test's outcome.\n7. **Method ID 189 (createSafeElement)**: This method creates a safe element, which is part of the process that could affect the test's results.\n8. **Method ID 2 (addTags)**: This method is related to adding tags to the whitelist, which is part of the setup but less directly involved than the top methods.\n9. **Method ID 3 (addAttributes)**: Similar to `addTags`, this method is involved in setting up the whitelist but is less critical than the top methods.\n10. **Method ID 4 (notEmpty)**: This method is a validation utility that checks for empty strings, which is less likely to be the source of the failure compared to the others."
