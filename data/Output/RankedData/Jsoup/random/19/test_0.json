The ranking is based on their relevance to the functionality being tested, which involves cleaning HTML with custom protocols in the `Jsoup.clean` method.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 138,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 189,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 145,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 182,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 138**: `addProtocols` - Directly related to adding custom protocols, which is central to the test.\n2. **Method ID 9**: `testValidProtocol` - Validates if a protocol is safe, which is crucial for the test's assertions.\n3. **Method ID 28**: `isSafeAttribute` - Checks if an attribute is safe, relevant to the cleaning process.\n4. **Method ID 107**: `createSafeElement` - Creates a safe element based on the whitelist, directly involved in the cleaning process.\n5. **Method ID 189**: `clean` - The main method being tested, responsible for cleaning the document.\n6. **Method ID 22**: `clean` (overloaded) - Another variant of the clean method, relevant to the test.\n7. **Method ID 145**: `basicWithImages` - Creates a whitelist that includes images, relevant to the test context.\n8. **Method ID 86**: `basic` - Creates a basic whitelist, foundational for the test.\n9. **Method ID 182**: `Cleaner` constructor - Initializes the cleaner with a whitelist, relevant to the setup.\n10. **Method ID 106**: `clean` (another variant) - Another variant of the clean method, relevant to the test. \n\nThese rankings reflect the methods' direct involvement in the functionality being tested and their potential to cause the test to fail."
