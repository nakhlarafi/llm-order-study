    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the test and their potential issues.\n\n1. **getCharsetFromContentType**: This method is directly tested in the test case. The test checks if the method correctly extracts the charset from a content type string that contains a duplicate charset declaration. Since the test is failing, this method is the most suspicious as it is the one being tested and is expected to handle the specific case of duplicate charset strings.\n\n2. **<clinit>**: This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class. While it sets up the `charsetPattern`, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure since it does not contain any logic that processes the input. However, if the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to issues in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method. Therefore, it is ranked second.\n\nGiven that there are only two methods covered in the test, we can rank them accordingly:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
