    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their relevance to the functionality being tested (handling of duplicate attributes in HTML parsing) and their involvement in the stack trace.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 83,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 83 (normalizeAttributes)**: Directly involved in normalizing attribute names, which is crucial for handling duplicate attributes.\n2. **Method ID 84 (normalize)**: This method normalizes the attribute keys, which is essential for the test case that checks for duplicate attributes.\n3. **Method ID 22 (parseInput)**: This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML, which is the main function being tested.\n4. **Method ID 19 (insert)**: This method is involved in inserting elements into the tree, which may affect how attributes are handled.\n5. **Method ID 7 (normalName)**: This method is responsible for returning the normalized name of a tag, which is relevant for attribute comparison.\n6. **Method ID 6 (normalName)**: Similar to method 7, it deals with the normalized name of tags.\n7. **Method ID 92 (normalizeTag)**: This method normalizes the tag names, which is relevant when dealing with attributes.\n8. **Method ID 92 (normalizeTag)**: Duplicate entry, as it is relevant for the same reasons as above.\n9. **Method ID 2 (process)**: This method processes tokens, which is relevant in the context of parsing HTML.\n10. **Method ID 1 (parent)**: While it is less directly related to the handling of attributes, it is still part of the node structure that could be affected by attribute handling."
