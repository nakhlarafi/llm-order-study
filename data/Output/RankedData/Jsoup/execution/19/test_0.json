    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the methods involved in the `handlesCustomProtocols` test case. The test is focused on cleaning HTML with custom protocols, which means the methods related to the `Jsoup.clean` functionality and the `Whitelist` class are particularly relevant.\n\nHere are the methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 169** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`\n   - This method is directly involved in adding protocols to the whitelist, which is crucial for the test case.\n\n2. **Method ID: 171** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)Z`\n   - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is essential for determining if the custom protocols are handled correctly.\n\n3. **Method ID: 187** - `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:clean(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - This method is responsible for cleaning the document, which is the main action being tested.\n\n4. **Method ID: 188** - `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I`\n   - This method copies safe nodes from the source to the destination, which is part of the cleaning process.\n\n5. **Method ID: 189** - `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Cleaner$ElementMeta;`\n   - This method creates a safe element based on the source element, which is relevant for the cleaning process.\n\n6. **Method ID: 165** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:basicWithImages()Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`\n   - This method creates a basic whitelist with images, which is used in the test.\n\n7. **Method ID: 170** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`\n   - This method checks if a tag is safe, which is important for the cleaning process.\n\n8. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n   - This method is a variant of the clean method that uses a whitelist, which is relevant to the test.\n\n9. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - This method parses the body fragment, which is part of the cleaning process.\n\n10. **Method ID: 2** - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n    - This method is another variant of the clean method that includes a base URI, which is less directly related but still part of the cleaning process.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"method_id\": 169, \"rank\": 1},\n    {\"method_id\": 171, \"rank\": 2},\n    {\"method_id\": 187, \"rank\": 3},\n    {\"method_id\": 188, \"rank\": 4},\n    {\"method_id\": 189, \"rank\": 5},\n    {\"method_id\": 165, \"rank\": 6},\n    {\"method_id\": 170, \"rank\": 7},\n    {\"method_id\": 1, \"rank\": 8},\n    {\"method_id\": 0, \"rank\": 9},\n    {\"method_id\": 2, \"rank\": 10}\n]\n```"
