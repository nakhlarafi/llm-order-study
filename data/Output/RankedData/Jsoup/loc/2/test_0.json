    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the parsing of HTML and the handling of text nodes. The test case specifically checks if the parser correctly handles text after a `<script>` tag, which suggests that methods related to parsing start tags, text nodes, and the overall parsing process are more suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods based on their relevance to the test case:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **parse()** - This method is responsible for the overall parsing logic, making it critical to the test case.\n2. **parseTextNode()** - Directly related to handling text nodes, which is essential for the test case.\n3. **parseEndTag()** - Involved in handling end tags, which could affect how text nodes are processed.\n4. **parseStartTag()** - Responsible for parsing start tags, which is relevant to the structure of the HTML being tested.\n5. **<init>()** (Parser constructor) - Initializes the parser, which is foundational for any parsing operation.\n6. **valueOf()** (Tag) - Converts string representations of tags into Tag objects, which is crucial for parsing.\n7. **<init>()** (Tag constructor) - Initializes Tag objects, which are essential for the parsing process.\n8. **equals()** (Tag) - Used for comparing tags, which is important in the context of parsing.\n9. **normalise()** (Document) - Normalizes the document structure, which could affect the final output.\n10. **<init>()** (Parser constructor with parameters) - Another constructor that sets up the parser, relevant for the parsing process.\n\nThese rankings are based on the methods' direct involvement in parsing and handling the specific HTML structure tested in the failing test case."
