    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the test and their potential issues. The test is focused on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method, which is responsible for extracting the charset from a given content type string. The test cases cover various scenarios, including valid charsets, null values, and unknown charsets.\n\nHere are the methods involved:\n\n1. **`getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)`** - This method is directly tested and is the primary suspect since the test is failing on its assertions.\n2. **`<clinit>()`** - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. If the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, we can rank the methods based on their likelihood of causing the failure:\n\n1. **`getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)`** - Most suspicious as it is the method being tested directly.\n2. **`<clinit>()`** - Less suspicious than the method being tested but still relevant since it initializes the pattern used in the method.\n\nSince there are only two methods involved, we can rank them accordingly. Here\u2019s the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
