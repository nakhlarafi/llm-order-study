The ranking is based on their relevance to the error message, which indicates that an attempt was made to call a real method on an abstract class, which is not allowed.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 113,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 44**: Directly related to the error message about calling a real method on an abstract class.\n2. **Method ID 113**: This method is responsible for reporting the error when trying to call an abstract method.\n3. **Method ID 1**: Involves handling invocations, which could be related to the error context.\n4. **Method ID 86**: This method is responsible for answering calls on mocks, which could lead to the error if not handled correctly.\n5. **Method ID 2**: Validates settings for mock creation, which could be relevant to the context of the test.\n6. **Method ID 3**: Similar to Method ID 2, it validates mock settings and could be involved in the error.\n7. **Method ID 4**: Related to method interception, which is relevant in the context of mocking.\n8. **Method ID 5**: Involves injecting mocks, which could be related to the test setup.\n9. **Method ID 6**: Related to setting up mock configurations, which could influence the behavior of the test.\n10. **Method ID 7**: Involves initializing mocks, which is part of the test setup and could be relevant to the failure."
