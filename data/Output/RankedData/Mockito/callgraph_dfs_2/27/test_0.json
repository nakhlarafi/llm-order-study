The ranking is based on their involvement in the failure of the test, particularly focusing on methods related to mocking, verification, and invocation handling.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 109,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 126,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 6 (verify)**: Directly related to the verification of the invocation, which is the core of the test failure.\n2. **Method ID 1 (reset)**: The reset method is crucial as it is called before the verification, potentially affecting the state of the mocks.\n3. **Method ID 0 (withSettings)**: This method is involved in the configuration of the mock, which is essential for the test setup.\n4. **Method ID 2 (resetMock)**: This method is responsible for resetting the mock, which is critical in the context of the test.\n5. **Method ID 109 (getInvocationListeners)**: This method retrieves the invocation listeners, which are relevant to the reporting of invocations.\n6. **Method ID 50 (verify)**: Related to the verification process, which is central to the test's assertion.\n7. **Method ID 84 (check)**: This method checks for missing invocations, which is directly related to the test failure.\n8. **Method ID 126 (verify)**: Another verification method that is involved in the process of checking invocations.\n9. **Method ID 7 (times)**: This method sets the expected number of invocations, which is relevant to the verification process.\n10. **Method ID 3 (getMockHandler)**: This method retrieves the mock handler, which is indirectly related to the verification process. \n\nThese rankings reflect the methods' roles in the context of the test failure, focusing on their involvement in mocking, verification, and invocation handling."
