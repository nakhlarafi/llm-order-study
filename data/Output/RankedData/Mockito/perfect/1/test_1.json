    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the covered methods, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious regarding the failure of the test. The test is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException`, which indicates that there is likely an issue with how the mocking framework is handling the invocation of the method `objectReturningMethod`.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to the failure are those involved in the invocation handling, argument matching, and stubbing processes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly involved in capturing arguments for the invocation, and the exception is thrown from this method.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and could be where the unsupported operation is triggered.\n3. **InvocationNotifierHandler.handle** - This method is part of the invocation handling chain and could also be involved in the failure.\n4. **InvocationContainerImpl.addAnswer** - This method is involved in adding answers to the invocation container, which is crucial for stubbing behavior.\n5. **MockingProgressImpl.stubbingCompleted** - This method is called when stubbing is completed and could be related to the state of the mocking progress.\n6. **MockSettingsImpl.stubOnly** - This method sets the mock to be stub-only, which is relevant to the test's context.\n7. **MockingProgressImpl.pullVerificationMode** - This method retrieves the verification mode, which is relevant to the verification process in the test.\n8. **InvocationMatcher.getInvocation** - This method retrieves the invocation associated with the matcher, which is relevant to the failure.\n9. **ThreadSafeMockingProgress.validateState** - This method validates the state of the mocking progress, which could be related to the exception.\n10. **MockCreationValidator.validateType** - This method validates the type of the mock being created, which could be relevant if the mock type is not handled correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 154,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 161,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 152,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test based on the stack trace and the context of the test."
