Since this is the only method involved in the test and it is failing, it is the most suspicious method. \n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there are no other methods covered in the test, we only have one method to rank."
