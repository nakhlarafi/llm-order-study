    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the deserialization process of the JSON string. The error indicates that the Gson library expected an integer but encountered a string instead. This suggests that the issue likely lies within the methods responsible for reading and interpreting the JSON input.\n\nHere are the top 10 most suspicious methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 79,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 7 (`nextInt()`)**: This method is directly responsible for reading an integer from the JSON input. The error message indicates that it expected an integer but found a string, making this method the most suspicious.\n   \n2. **Method ID 79 (`read(JsonReader in)`)**: This method is part of the `MapTypeAdapterFactory` and is responsible for reading a map from the JSON input. It is closely related to the deserialization process and could be involved in interpreting the keys and values.\n\n3. **Method ID 18 (`create(Gson gson, TypeToken<T> typeToken)`)**: This method creates a type adapter for maps. If the type adapter is not correctly handling the integer keys, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\n4. **Method ID 22 (`fromJson(JsonReader reader, Type typeOfT)`)**: This method is responsible for deserializing JSON using a `JsonReader`. It plays a crucial role in the overall deserialization process.\n\n5. **Method ID 5 (`fromJson(String json, Type typeOfT)`)**: This method converts a JSON string into an object of the specified type. It is a higher-level method that ultimately calls the lower-level methods.\n\n6. **Method ID 4 (`checkNotNull(Object obj)`)**: This method checks for null values. While it may not directly cause the issue, it is part of the validation process during deserialization.\n\n7. **Method ID 3 (`fromJson(Reader json, Type typeOfT)`)**: Similar to method ID 5, this method is responsible for deserializing JSON from a `Reader`. It is part of the deserialization chain.\n\n8. **Method ID 2 (`getAdapter(TypeToken<T> type)`)**: This method retrieves the appropriate type adapter for the given type. If the wrong adapter is retrieved, it could lead to deserialization issues.\n\n9. **Method ID 1 (`nullSafe()`)**: This method ensures that the type adapter is null-safe. While it is not directly related to the error, it is part of the type adapter's functionality.\n\n10. **Method ID 0 (`<clinit>()`)**: This is a static initializer for the `SqlDateTypeAdapter`. It is the least suspicious as it is not directly involved in the deserialization of the map with integer keys."
