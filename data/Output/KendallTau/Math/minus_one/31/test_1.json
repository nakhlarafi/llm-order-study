    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test failure and coverage information, we will analyze the methods that are directly involved in the computation of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, as this is the core functionality being tested and is where the failure occurred.\n\nThe following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability`** - This is the method being tested directly, and any issues here would directly cause the test to fail.\n2. **`cumulativeProbability`** - This method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability` and is crucial for its computation.\n3. **`getSupportLowerBound`** and **`getSupportUpperBound`** - These methods are used to determine the bounds for the probability calculations.\n4. **`getNumericalMean`** and **`getNumericalVariance`** - These methods are used to calculate statistical properties that may affect the results.\n5. **`regularizedBeta`** - This method is involved in the calculations for the cumulative probability and thus can affect the outcome of the inverse calculation.\n6. **`calculateNumericalVariance`** - This method is called to compute variance, which is important for the distribution's properties.\n7. **`getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom`** and **`getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom`** - These methods provide necessary parameters for the calculations.\n8. **`BrentSolver`** - This solver is used to find roots in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, and any issues here could lead to failures.\n9. **`NoBracketingException`** - This exception is thrown if the solver cannot find a valid interval, indicating a potential issue in the bounds or the function being solved.\n10. **`logGamma`** - This method is used in the calculations of the beta function and can affect the results indirectly.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be causing the failure in the test based on their roles in the computation of the inverse cumulative probability."
