    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and coverage information, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the failure and those that are closely related to the computation leading to the exception.\n\n1. **NormalDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability(D)** - This method is directly called in the test and is where the exception originates.\n2. **AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(D)** - This method is a superclass method that is also involved in the call chain leading to the exception.\n3. **NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(D)** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is part of the computation that leads to the exception.\n4. **UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)** - This method is involved in the bracketing process for finding roots, which is part of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n5. **UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)** - Similar to the previous method, this is another overload that may be involved in the bracketing process.\n6. **NormalDistributionImpl.getDomainLowerBound(D)** - This method is called to determine the lower bound for the bracketing process.\n7. **NormalDistributionImpl.getDomainUpperBound(D)** - This method is called to determine the upper bound for the bracketing process.\n8. **NormalDistributionImpl.getMean()** - This method is used to retrieve the mean, which is essential for the calculations in `cumulativeProbability`.\n9. **NormalDistributionImpl.getStandardDeviation()** - This method retrieves the standard deviation, which is also crucial for the calculations in `cumulativeProbability`.\n10. **Erf.erf(D)** - This method is used in the `cumulativeProbability` method and is part of the calculations that could lead to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
