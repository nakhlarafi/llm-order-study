    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and coverage information, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the failure and those that are closely related to the logic of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - This is the method being tested and is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (AbstractContinuousDistribution)** - This method is called by the `NormalDistributionImpl`'s `inverseCumulativeProbability` and is part of the failure path.\n3. **`bracket` (UnivariateRealSolverUtils)** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is part of the logic that leads to the convergence exception.\n4. **`getDomainLowerBound` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - This method is used to determine the lower bound for the bracketing process, which is critical for finding the root.\n5. **`getDomainUpperBound` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - Similar to the lower bound, this method is used to determine the upper bound for the bracketing process.\n6. **`cumulativeProbability` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - This method is called within the root-finding function and is essential for the calculations leading to the convergence issue.\n7. **`setStandardDeviation` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - This method is involved in setting up the distribution parameters, which could affect the behavior of the `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n8. **`setMean` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - Similar to `setStandardDeviation`, this method sets the mean of the distribution, which is crucial for the calculations.\n9. **`getInitialDomain` (NormalDistributionImpl)** - This method is used to determine the initial guess for the root-finding process, which is relevant to the convergence issue.\n10. **`logGamma` (Gamma)** - While not directly involved in the failure, it is part of the mathematical functions that may be used in related calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
