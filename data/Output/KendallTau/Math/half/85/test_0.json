    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and coverage information, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the failure, particularly those related to the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and the exceptions thrown.\n\n1. **NormalDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D** - This is the method being tested and is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D** - This is the superclass method that is called within the `NormalDistributionImpl` method.\n3. **UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)[D** - This method is likely involved in the root-finding process and could be related to the convergence issue.\n4. **NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(D)D** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is part of the calculation.\n5. **NormalDistributionImpl.getDomainLowerBound(D)D** - This method is called to determine the lower bound for the root-finding process.\n6. **NormalDistributionImpl.getDomainUpperBound(D)D** - This method is called to determine the upper bound for the root-finding process.\n7. **NormalDistributionImpl.getInitialDomain(D)D** - This method is involved in determining the initial guess for the root-finding process.\n8. **MathException.<init>(Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V** - This constructor is involved in creating the exception that is thrown, indicating a problem occurred.\n9. **ConvergenceException.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)V** - This constructor is related to the specific exception that indicates a convergence issue.\n10. **UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)[D** - This is another variant of the bracket method that may also be involved in the convergence issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
