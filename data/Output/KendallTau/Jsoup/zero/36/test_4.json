    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the test and their relevance to the failure. The test is focused on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method, which is directly tested through various assertions. The static initializer (`<clinit>`) is also relevant as it initializes the `charsetPattern` used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **getCharsetFromContentType** - This method is directly tested and is the main focus of the assertions. Any failure in the test is likely due to an issue within this method.\n2. **<clinit>** - This method initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is crucial for the functionality of `getCharsetFromContentType`. If the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the main method being tested.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, the ranking will reflect that. Here\u2019s the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
