    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness in relation to the failing test. The test is focused on handling custom protocols in HTML cleaning, which suggests that methods related to the `Whitelist`, `Cleaner`, and `Tokeniser` are particularly relevant.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 66,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 98,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 55,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 120 (`addProtocols`)**: Directly related to adding protocols to the whitelist, which is crucial for the test case.\n2. **Method ID 66 (`testValidProtocol`)**: This method checks if a protocol is valid, which is central to the test's purpose.\n3. **Method ID 24 (`basicWithImages`)**: This method sets up a whitelist that includes images, relevant to the test.\n4. **Method ID 85 (`clean`)**: This method is responsible for cleaning the document, which is the main action being tested.\n5. **Method ID 77 (`Cleaner`)**: The constructor for the `Cleaner` class, which is involved in the cleaning process.\n6. **Method ID 98 (`copySafeNodes`)**: This method copies safe nodes, which is part of the cleaning process.\n7. **Method ID 90 (`isSafeAttribute`)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is relevant to the test's validation of attributes.\n8. **Method ID 1 (`parseBodyFragment`)**: This method parses the body of the HTML, which is part of the cleaning process.\n9. **Method ID 55 (`clean`)**: Another variant of the clean method, relevant to the overall cleaning process.\n10. **Method ID 136 (`clean`)**: This method is a higher-level clean method that ties together the cleaning process, making it relevant to the test.\n\nThese rankings are based on the relevance of each method to the functionality being tested and their potential impact on the test's outcome."
