    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of causing the failure.\n\n1. **getCharsetFromContentType**: This method is directly tested in the failing test case. The test checks how the method handles empty charset values, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **<clinit>**: This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. If there were an issue with the pattern itself, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `getCharsetFromContentType`. However, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure compared to the method being tested.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
