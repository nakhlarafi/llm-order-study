The test methods that are failing are also related to the setup of the test class, which calls `isAvailableLocale`. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSince only one method is covered in the provided information, it is ranked as the most suspicious. If there were more methods involved, they would be ranked accordingly based on their relation to the failure and their coverage in the stack trace."
