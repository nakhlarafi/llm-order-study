    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test case. The test case is failing because the expected result does not match the actual result when calling the `StringUtils.containsNone` method. \n\nThe methods covered in the test are:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nThe first method is a wrapper that converts the `String` to a `char[]` and calls the second method. The second method performs the actual logic to check if any characters in the `searchChars` are present in the `cs`.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The failure occurs in the `containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)` method, which indicates that the issue likely lies in how the method handles the input parameters, particularly with supplementary characters.\n- The second method (`containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`) is where the actual character comparison happens, so it is also suspicious.\n- Since the test is specifically checking for edge cases involving supplementary characters, both methods are equally suspicious, but the first method is more likely to be the source of the problem due to its handling of the input.\n\n### Ranking:\n1. `containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)` - Most suspicious due to the failure occurring in this method.\n2. `containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)` - Also suspicious as it contains the core logic for character comparison.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly. The remaining methods will be ranked as not suspicious.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
