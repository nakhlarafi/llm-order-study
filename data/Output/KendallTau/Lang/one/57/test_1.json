The other methods in the stack trace are part of the test setup and execution, but they do not directly contribute to the failure. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince only one method is covered and it is the one that caused the exception, it is ranked as the most suspicious. There are no other methods to rank in this case."
