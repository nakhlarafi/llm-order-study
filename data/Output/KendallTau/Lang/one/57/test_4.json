The other methods in the stack trace are part of the test setup and execution, but they are not the direct cause of the failure. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, only the `isAvailableLocale` method is identified as suspicious due to the direct link to the exception. Other methods in the stack trace are part of the test framework and do not contribute to the failure directly."
