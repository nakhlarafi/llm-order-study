The ranking is based on their involvement in the exception thrown, the context of the error, and their relevance to the failing test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 144,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 164,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 144**: This method is directly involved in the exception thrown, indicating that it attempts to extract a raw type from a type variable, which is not supported.\n2. **Method ID 125**: This method is responsible for extracting the actual bounded type of a type variable, which is relevant to the error context.\n3. **Method ID 41**: This method resolves the generic return type, which is crucial in the context of generics and type variables.\n4. **Method ID 42**: Similar to method 41, it deals with actual parameterized types, which are directly related to the error.\n5. **Method ID 3**: This method finds answers for invocations, which is part of the mocking process that leads to the error.\n6. **Method ID 0**: This method registers type variables, which is relevant to the handling of generics.\n7. **Method ID 164**: This method answers invocations and is involved in the deep stubbing process, which is central to the test.\n8. **Method ID 48**: This method is part of the deep stubbing mechanism, which is directly related to the test case.\n9. **Method ID 1**: This method handles invocation and is part of the mock handling process.\n10. **Method ID 4**: This method checks for answers for stubbing, which is part of the invocation handling process.\n\nThe ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the error and their relevance to the test case that failed."
