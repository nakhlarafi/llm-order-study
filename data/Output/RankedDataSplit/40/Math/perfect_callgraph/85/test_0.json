The ranking is based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause the `ConvergenceException` that led to the test failure.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 13**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` is directly involved in the computation that leads to the exception.\n2. **Method ID 25**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is also directly involved in the computation and is called from the test.\n3. **Method ID 0**: `bracket` method in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` is called during the process of finding the root, which is critical in the context of convergence.\n4. **Method ID 9**: `cumulativeProbability` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is used to evaluate the function for the root-finding process.\n5. **Method ID 1**: Constructor of `AbstractContinuousDistribution`, which is a base class for `NormalDistributionImpl`.\n6. **Method ID 4**: `logGamma` method, which may be indirectly related to the calculations in the distribution.\n7. **Method ID 5**: `erf` method, which is used in the cumulative probability calculations.\n8. **Method ID 3**: `setStandardDeviation`, which could affect the distribution's behavior if set incorrectly.\n9. **Method ID 21**: `getDomainUpperBound`, which is involved in determining the bounds for the root-finding process.\n10. **Method ID 17**: `getDomainLowerBound`, which is also involved in determining the bounds for the root-finding process. \n\nThese rankings reflect the likelihood of each method contributing to the failure of the test based on their roles in the stack trace and the nature of the exception encountered."
