    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failing test. The test indicates that there is a `NoSuchMethodError` when trying to call a real method on an interface, which suggests that the method resolution is failing at runtime.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this failure are those involved in invoking real methods and handling method proxies. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the following order:\n\n1. `CGLIBProxyRealMethod.invoke`\n2. `FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod.invoke`\n3. `Invocation.callRealMethod`\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method is directly involved in the invocation that leads to the error.\n2. **Rank 2**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method is responsible for invoking the real method and is part of the stack trace.\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method is also involved in the invocation chain leading to the error.\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.MockitoStubber:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V` - This method is involved in adding the answer that calls the real method.\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.mockito.Mockito:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;` - This method is used to set up the stubbing that leads to the invocation of the real method.\n6. **Rank 6**: `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;` - Similar to the previous method, it is part of the stubbing process.\n7. **Rank 7**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()Z` - This method checks if the invocation is void, which may not be directly related but is part of the invocation handling.\n8. **Rank 8**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:argumentsToMatchers()Ljava/util/List;` - This method is less relevant but still part of the invocation handling.\n9. **Rank 9**: `org.mockito.Mockito:withSettings()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;` - This method is related to mock settings but is less relevant to the current failure.\n10. **Rank 10**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.MockitoStubber:stub()Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/IOngoingStubbing;` - This method is involved in the stubbing process but is less directly related to the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
