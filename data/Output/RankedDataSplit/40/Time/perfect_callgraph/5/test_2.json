    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the new test case and its stack trace to determine if any of the previously ranked methods should be adjusted in terms of their suspicion level.\n\nThe test case `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` that occurs when trying to set a field in the `Period` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class, which is ranked 8 in the previous ranking. This suggests that the `normalizedStandard` method is indeed suspicious, as it is directly involved in the failure.\n\nAdditionally, the method `getIndexedField` from `PeriodType` is also covered in the stack trace, and it is responsible for retrieving the indexed field value from the `ReadablePeriod`. This method is now relevant to the failure and should be considered suspicious as well.\n\nGiven this new information, we will adjust the rankings accordingly:\n\n1. The `normalizedStandard` method (Rank 8) will be elevated in suspicion due to its direct involvement in the failure.\n2. The `getIndexedField` method will be added to the ranking as it is now relevant to the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking:\n- The `normalizedStandard` method is now ranked 1 due to its direct involvement in the test failure.\n- The `getIndexedField` method is ranked 2 as it is also implicated in the failure.\n- The other methods retain their previous ranks, as they were not directly implicated in the new test failure."
