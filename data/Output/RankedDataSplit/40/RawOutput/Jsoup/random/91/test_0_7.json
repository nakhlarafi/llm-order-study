    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the test case and the methods that were covered during its execution. The test case `testBinaryThrowsExceptionWhenTypeIgnored` is primarily focused on the `ignoreContentType` method and the handling of binary data in the connection.\n\nGiven that the test is designed to check for exceptions when binary data is sent and the content type is ignored, the following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request:data(Lorg/jsoup/Connection$KeyVal;)`** - This method is responsible for adding data to the request. Since the test is adding binary data, this method is highly suspicious.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:ignoreContentType(Z)`** - This method is directly invoked in the test to ignore the content type, making it very relevant to the test's purpose.\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request:requestBody()`** - This method returns the body of the request, which may be involved in the handling of the binary data.\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request:data()`** - This method returns the collection of data added to the request, which is also relevant to the test.\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Base:method()`** - This method returns the HTTP method being used, which could be relevant depending on how the request is constructed.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>(Lorg/jsoup/parser/TreeBuilder;)`** - This method is less relevant but could be involved in parsing the response.\n7. **`org.jsoup.select.Evaluator:<init>()`** - This method is likely not relevant to the test.\n8. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$KeyVal:create(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)`** - This method creates a key-value pair, which is relevant when adding data to the request.\n9. **`org.jsoup.Connection$Method:hasBody()`** - This method checks if the HTTP method has a body, which could be relevant depending on the request type.\n10. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request:requestBody()`** - This method is already mentioned and is relevant.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the test case. The methods that are directly involved in the test case will be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 124,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 127,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 178,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 145,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 150,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking, the `ignoreContentType` method is now ranked first due to its direct invocation in the test, followed by the `data` method which is also crucial for adding data to the request. The `requestBody` method remains relevant but is ranked lower as it is not directly tested in this case."
