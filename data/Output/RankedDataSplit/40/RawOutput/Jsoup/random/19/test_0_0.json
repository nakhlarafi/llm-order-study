    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, we can analyze the methods that are covered by the test and rank them based on their relevance to the failure. The test is focused on cleaning HTML with custom protocols, which suggests that methods related to attribute handling, protocol validation, and the cleaning process are more suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 28**: `isSafeAttribute` - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is directly related to the test's focus on custom protocols.\n2. **Method ID 9**: `testValidProtocol` - This method tests if a protocol is valid, which is crucial for the functionality being tested.\n3. **Method ID 31**: `addAttributes` - This method adds attributes to the whitelist, which is relevant to the test's setup.\n4. **Method ID 22**: `clean` - This is the main cleaning method being tested, making it highly relevant.\n5. **Method ID 3**: `isTrue` - This method validates boolean conditions, which could be involved in checks during the cleaning process.\n6. **Method ID 2**: `put` - This method adds attributes to a collection, which is relevant for handling the attributes of elements.\n7. **Method ID 1**: `runParser` - This method runs the parser, which is part of the cleaning process.\n8. **Method ID 5**: `emitTagPending` - This method finalizes tags, which is part of the parsing and cleaning process.\n9. **Method ID 4**: `isSelfClosing` - This method checks if a tag is self-closing, which could affect how tags are processed.\n10. **Method ID 0**: `attributes` - This method retrieves attributes, which is fundamental to the handling of elements in the cleaning process.\n\nThese rankings are based on the relevance of each method to the functionality being tested and the likelihood that they could be involved in the failure observed in the test."
