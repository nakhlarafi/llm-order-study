    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the test `handlesCustomProtocols`. The test specifically checks the behavior of the `addProtocols` method in the `Whitelist` class, which is already ranked as the most suspicious method. \n\nThe test also indirectly involves the `testValidProtocol` method, as it checks whether the protocols are correctly validated when cleaning the HTML. This means that both `addProtocols` and `testValidProtocol` are critical to the functionality being tested.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the rankings as follows:\n\n1. **`addProtocols`** remains the most suspicious since it is directly tested and is responsible for adding protocols.\n2. **`testValidProtocol`** should be moved up to rank 2, as it is also directly involved in the validation of protocols.\n3. The other methods remain unchanged in their rankings since they are not directly involved in the test case.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 59,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the importance of the methods in relation to the test case provided."
