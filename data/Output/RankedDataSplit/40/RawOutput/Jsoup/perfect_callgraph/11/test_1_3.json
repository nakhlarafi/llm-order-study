    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the newly covered methods on the existing ranking of the most suspicious methods. The test `notClass` specifically interacts with the `select` method, which is already ranked as the most suspicious. \n\nThe newly covered methods do not directly affect the existing methods' rankings, but they do provide insight into the functionality being tested. The `select` method is still the most relevant to the test case, as it is responsible for parsing the selector string and returning the appropriate elements.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new coverage information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 111,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, the rankings remain unchanged as the most suspicious methods are still relevant to the test case and the newly covered methods do not introduce any new suspicions or issues that would warrant a change in their ranking."
