    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the test `org.jsoup.nodes.AttributeTest.booleanAttributesAreEmptyStringValues`. The test specifically checks the behavior of the `Attributes` class when dealing with boolean attributes, which are expected to have empty string values.\n\nThe following methods are now relevant based on the new coverage data:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:checkNotNull(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is called to ensure that the value is not null, returning an empty string if it is. This is directly related to the test case since it checks the value of the \"hidden\" attribute.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:add(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V`** - This method adds a new key-value pair to the attributes. It is relevant because the test involves adding the \"hidden\" attribute.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`** - This method is responsible for putting a key-value pair into the attributes, which is also relevant to the test.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V`** - This method normalizes the attribute keys, which may be indirectly related to the test if the attribute keys are being normalized.\n\nGiven that the test case is focused on the behavior of attributes, particularly the handling of boolean attributes, we can adjust the ranking of the methods accordingly. The methods that are directly involved in the test should be ranked higher due to their relevance.\n\nHere is the updated ranking based on the new coverage information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 79,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the methods that were covered by the test and are directly related to the functionality being tested are ranked higher, reflecting their increased suspicion based on the new data."
