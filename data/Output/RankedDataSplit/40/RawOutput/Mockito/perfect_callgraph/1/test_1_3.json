    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are most suspicious in relation to the failing test. The test `test_stub_only_not_verifiable` indicates that there is an issue with the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called during the handling of method invocations.\n\nGiven that the stack trace points to `InvocationMatcher` and the methods that are involved in the stubbing and invocation process, we can adjust the ranking of the methods accordingly. The methods that are directly related to the invocation handling and stubbing are now more suspicious due to their involvement in the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 122,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 157,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Rank 1 to 7**: The methods related to `InvocationMatcher`, `MockitoCore`, and stubbing are retained at the top due to their direct involvement in the invocation process.\n- **Rank 8**: The `notifyMethodCall` method is now included as it is part of the invocation handling process and could be related to the failure.\n- **Rank 9 and 10**: The `thenReturn` and `handle` methods are included as they are part of the stubbing and invocation handling, which are critical in the context of the test that failed.\n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the methods that are most likely to be causing the issues in the failing test."
