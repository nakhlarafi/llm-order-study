    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are most suspicious in relation to the failing test. The test indicates that there is an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurring, which suggests that the issue may be related to the handling of method calls or argument matching.\n\nGiven the context of the test, the following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely involved in capturing the arguments for the mocked method call.\n2. **InvocationNotifierHandler.handle** - This method is also in the stack trace and is responsible for handling the invocation, which could be where the exception is thrown.\n3. **ArgumentsComparator.argumentsMatch** - This method is responsible for checking if the arguments match, which is crucial for the stubbing to work correctly.\n\nConsidering these observations, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failing test and the stack trace. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 57,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 116,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Rank 1**: `InvocationNotifierHandler.handle` is now ranked highest because it is directly involved in handling the invocation and is mentioned in the stack trace.\n- **Rank 2**: `ArgumentsComparator.argumentsMatch` is now ranked second as it is crucial for argument matching, which is essential for the stubbing to work correctly.\n- The other methods retain their previous ranks as they are still relevant but less directly connected to the failure indicated by the stack trace."
