    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their relevance to the failing test case, particularly focusing on the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and its dependencies.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 16**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly related to the failing test, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 12**: The constructor of `FDistribution`, which is essential for creating the distribution object used in the test.\n3. **Method ID 25**: `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is called within the `getNumericalMean` method, which is part of the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n4. **Method ID 1**: The `Incrementor` class is used for managing counts, which may indirectly affect the calculations.\n5. **Method ID 3**: `getMin` is part of the solver's functionality, which is relevant for finding roots in the `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n6. **Method ID 4**: `getFunctionValueAccuracy` is also part of the solver's configuration, affecting the precision of calculations.\n7. **Method ID 6**: `FastMath:abs` is a utility method that could be used in various calculations, including those in the solver.\n8. **Method ID 5**: The overloaded `regularizedBeta` method is part of the calculations that may be involved in the distribution's behavior.\n9. **Method ID 34**: `computeObjectiveValue` is part of the solving process, which is crucial for the `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n10. **Method ID 30**: `doSolve` is part of the solving mechanism, which is essential for the functionality of the `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' direct and indirect involvement in the failing test case, with a focus on the calculations related to the `FDistribution` and its methods."
