The ranking is primarily based on their involvement in the stack trace and their relation to the concurrent modification exception.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 10** (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap$Iterator:advance`): Directly involved in throwing the concurrent modification exception.\n2. **Method ID 7** (`OpenMapRealVector:ebeMultiply`): Called in the stack trace and is responsible for the multiplication operation that leads to the exception.\n3. **Method ID 6** (`OpenMapRealVector:setEntry`): This method modifies the vector and could lead to concurrent modification if called during iteration.\n4. **Method ID 1** (`AbstractRealVector:checkIndex`): Validates the index before setting an entry, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the vector during modifications.\n5. **Method ID 3** (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:containsKey`): Checks if a key exists, which is part of the modification process.\n6. **Method ID 4** (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:hashOf`): Used in the process of managing keys in the hash map, indirectly related to the modification.\n7. **Method ID 2** (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:get`): Retrieves values from the hash map, which is part of the operation that could lead to concurrent modification.\n8. **Method ID 5** (`OpenMapRealVector:setEntry`): Directly modifies the entries of the vector, which is critical in the context of concurrent modifications.\n9. **Method ID 9** (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:iterator`): Creates an iterator, which is essential for the iteration process that leads to the exception.\n10. **Method ID 11** (`FastMath:abs`): While not directly related to the exception, it is part of the mathematical operations that could be involved in the vector operations. \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the exception and their roles in the operations leading to the failure."
