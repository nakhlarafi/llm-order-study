The methods that are directly involved in the optimization process or are related to the `CMAESOptimizer` are considered more suspicious.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the methods' involvement in the optimization process, their potential to affect the outcome of the test, and their proximity to the failure point in the stack trace."
