The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and the stack trace, particularly focusing on methods that are directly related to the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, as well as those that are part of the `FDistribution` class and its dependencies.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking prioritizes methods that are directly involved in the computation of the inverse cumulative probability and related calculations, as these are likely to be the source of the failure in the test."
