The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and their complexity, as well as the likelihood of them causing issues in the context of the test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking considers the methods that are directly related to file writing and data handling, which are critical in the context of the test that involves compressing files. Methods that handle file attributes, CRC values, and data output are prioritized as they are likely to be the source of the failure."
