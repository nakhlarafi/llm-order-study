    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the additional methods that were covered by the failing test. The test indicates that the expected bucket count was 16384, but the actual bucket count was 32768, which suggests that the method responsible for calculating or managing the bucket count may be involved in the failure.\n\nThe newly covered methods are:\n\n1. **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)** - This method resets the symbol table, which could affect the size and bucket count.\n2. **_spilloverStart()** - This method calculates the starting point for spillover, which is relevant for managing collisions.\n3. **_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)** - This method calculates the tertiary shift based on the number of primary slots, which is directly related to how the bucket count is determined.\n4. **TableInfo constructor** - This method initializes the TableInfo object, which may be involved in managing the state of the symbol table.\n5. **InternCache constructor** - This method initializes the intern cache, which is less likely to be directly related to the bucket count issue.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the new methods covered, we can adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods. The methods that are directly related to the bucket count and the management of the symbol table should be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)** is now ranked first because it directly influences how the bucket count is calculated.\n- **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)** and **_spilloverStart()** are ranked next as they are involved in managing the state of the symbol table and could affect the bucket count.\n- The previously ranked methods are adjusted downwards as they are less directly related to the specific failure observed in the test."
