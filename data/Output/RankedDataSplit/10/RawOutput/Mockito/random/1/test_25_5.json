    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that were involved in the failure of the test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing`. The stack trace indicates that the `UnsupportedOperationException` occurred in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called by `MockHandlerImpl.handle`. This suggests that the methods related to invocation handling and argument capturing are more suspicious.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods as follows:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(...)` - This method is directly involved in handling the invocation and is the first point of failure in the stack trace.\n2. **Rank 2**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom(...)` - This method is where the exception was thrown, making it highly suspicious.\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.MatchersBinder:bindMatchers(...)` - This method is involved in binding matchers to invocations, which is relevant to the test case.\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCall(...)` - This method is part of the invocation handling process.\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer(...)` - This method is related to stubbing behavior, which is relevant to the test.\n6. **Rank 6**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validateDefaultAnswerReturnedValue(...)` - This method validates the return value of the default answer, which could be related to the stubbing process.\n7. **Rank 7**: `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:validateState(...)` - This method validates the state of mocking, which could be relevant in the context of resetting mocks.\n8. **Rank 8**: `org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:reportOngoingStubbing(...)` - This method reports ongoing stubbing, which is part of the mocking process.\n9. **Rank 9**: `org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:getDefaultAnswer(...)` - This method retrieves the default answer for mocks, which is less directly related but still relevant.\n10. **Rank 10**: `org.mockito.configuration.DefaultMockitoConfiguration:getDefaultAnswer(...)` - Similar to the previous method, this retrieves the default answer but is less suspicious than others.\n\nNow, let's format this updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
