    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The stack trace indicates that the `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is part of the `InvocationMatcher` class. This suggests that the methods related to invocation handling and argument capturing are more suspicious.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failing test. The methods that are directly involved in the invocation handling and argument capturing should be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 151,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 143,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 126,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 137,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 161,\n        \"rank\": 11\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 160,\n        \"rank\": 12\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The methods related to `InvocationMatcher` and `MockHandlerImpl` remain at the top of the ranking as they are directly involved in the invocation handling process.\n- The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom` is implicated in the stack trace, which reinforces the suspicion around the methods that deal with invocation and argument capturing.\n- The new methods added to the ranking (IDs 160 and 161) are related to mock creation and injection, which are also relevant to the context of the test, but they are ranked lower than the core invocation handling methods. \n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the context of the failing test."
