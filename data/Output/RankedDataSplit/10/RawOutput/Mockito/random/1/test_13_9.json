    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods that were covered during the test execution. The test indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` was thrown, which points to a potential issue in the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that the methods related to argument matching and invocation handling are more suspicious.\n\nGiven the new context, we can adjust the ranking of the previously identified methods. The methods that are directly involved in handling invocations and argument matching will be prioritized.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 79,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Rank 1-8**: The methods related to invocation matching and handling remain at the top of the list as they are directly involved in the stack trace.\n- **Rank 9**: The method `createRegisteredInvocations` remains in the same position as it is still relevant to the invocation handling process.\n- **Rank 10**: The method `confirm` from `MockSettingsImpl` is added to the list as it is now relevant due to the new test context, which involves mock creation and settings validation.\n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the methods that are most likely to be causing the issues indicated by the failing tests."
