    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are now covered and their relevance to the failing test. The test indicates an issue with handling method stubbing, particularly when the latest stubbing is evaluated.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the exception occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is part of the invocation handling process. This suggests that methods related to invocation handling and stubbing are more suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - Method ID: 12\n   - Reason: This method is directly involved in handling invocations and is part of the stack trace.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;Z)V`\n   - Method ID: 119\n   - Reason: This method is responsible for adding answers to invocations, which is crucial for stubbing behavior.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:setInvocationForPotentialStubbing(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;)V`\n   - Method ID: 134\n   - Reason: This method sets the invocation for potential stubbing, which is relevant to the test case.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - Method ID: 153\n   - Reason: This method handles invocations and is part of the stack trace, indicating it may be involved in the failure.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:pullOngoingStubbing()Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/IOngoingStubbing;`\n   - Method ID: 155\n   - Reason: This method pulls ongoing stubbing, which is directly related to the test case.\n\n6. **Rank: 6**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - Method ID: 73\n   - Reason: This method processes annotations, which may indirectly affect stubbing behavior.\n\n7. **Rank: 7**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.SpyAnnotationEngine:process(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - Method ID: 123\n   - Reason: Similar to the previous method, it processes annotations but is less directly related to the stubbing issue.\n\n8. **Rank: 8**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V`\n   - Method ID: 60\n   - Reason: This method adds an answer without specifying if it is consecutive, which may be relevant.\n\n9. **Rank: 9**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingStarted()V`\n   - Method ID: 102\n   - Reason: This method indicates the start of stubbing, which is relevant but less suspicious than others.\n\n10. **Rank: 10**\n    - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.verification.DefaultRegisteredInvocations:isEmpty()Z`\n    - Method ID: 132\n    - Reason: This method checks if there are any registered invocations, which is less relevant to the current issue.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 119,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 153,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 155,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 73,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 132,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
