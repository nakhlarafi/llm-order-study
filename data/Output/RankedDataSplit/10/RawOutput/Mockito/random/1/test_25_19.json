    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are involved in the failure of the test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing`. The stack trace indicates that the `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called within the `MockHandlerImpl.handle` method. This suggests that the methods related to invocation handling and argument capturing are more suspicious.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure and the new coverage information. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - **Method ID:** 19\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - **Reason:** This method is directly involved in handling the invocation and is where the exception is thrown.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - **Method ID:** 134\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/stubbing/StubbedInvocationMatcher;`\n   - **Reason:** This method is responsible for finding the answer for a given invocation, which is crucial in the context of stubbing.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - **Method ID:** 101\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - **Reason:** This method wraps the handling of invocations and is involved in notifying method calls.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - **Method ID:** 123\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.Mockito:withSettings()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;`\n   - **Reason:** This method is related to mock settings, which can influence how stubbing behaves.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - **Method ID:** 41\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n   - **Reason:** This method is involved in setting up answers for stubbings, which is relevant to the test.\n\n6. **Rank: 6**\n   - **Method ID:** 171\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V`\n   - **Reason:** This method adds answers to the invocation container, which is relevant to the stubbing process.\n\n7. **Rank: 7**\n   - **Method ID:** 6\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validateDefaultAnswerReturnedValue(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - **Reason:** This method validates the returned value from answers, which is important for ensuring correct behavior.\n\n8. **Rank: 8**\n   - **Method ID:** 5\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:validateState()V`\n   - **Reason:** This method validates the state of mocking, which can affect how stubbing is handled.\n\n9. **Rank: 9**\n   - **Method ID:** 180\n   - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:setExtraInterfaces(Ljava/util/Set;)Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;`\n   - **Reason:** This method sets extra interfaces for creation settings, which may indirectly affect stubbing.\n\n10. **Rank: 10**\n    - **Method ID:** 192\n    - **Method Signature:** `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.BaseStubbing:thenReturn(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n    - **Reason:** This method is involved in returning values for stubbings, which is relevant but less directly connected to the failure.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 180,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 192,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
