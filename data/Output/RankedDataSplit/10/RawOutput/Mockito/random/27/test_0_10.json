    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the context of the failing test and the methods that were covered. The test indicates that the `invocationListener.reportInvocation` method was expected to be called but was not, which suggests that the methods responsible for handling invocations and reporting them may be more suspicious.\n\nGiven the new data, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the test case and the failure observed. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - **Method ID:** 88\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;\n   - **Reason:** This method is responsible for handling invocations and notifying the listener. Since the test failed due to the listener not being notified, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - **Method ID:** 100\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:<init>(Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/MockingProgress;)V\n   - **Reason:** This constructor initializes the `InvocationContainerImpl`, which is crucial for managing invocations and their listeners. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to the listener not being notified.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - **Method ID:** 101\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationDataImpl:getWanted()Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;\n   - **Reason:** This method retrieves the expected invocation data, which is relevant to the verification process. If the expected invocations are not set correctly, it could lead to the failure observed.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - **Method ID:** 104\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:wantedButNotInvoked(Lorg/mockito/exceptions/PrintableInvocation;Ljava/util/List;)V\n   - **Reason:** This method is responsible for reporting when an expected invocation was not made. It is directly related to the failure message in the test.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - **Method ID:** 60\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:verify(Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/api/VerificationData;)V\n   - **Reason:** This method verifies the number of invocations, which is relevant to the test case as it checks if the listener was invoked the expected number of times.\n\n6. **Rank: 6**\n   - **Method ID:** 102\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.Mockito:times(I)Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;\n   - **Reason:** This method is used to specify the number of expected invocations, which is relevant to the verification process.\n\n7. **Rank: 7**\n   - **Method ID:** 106\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.invocation.MatchersBinder:bindMatchers(Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/ArgumentMatcherStorage;Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;\n   - **Reason:** This method binds matchers to invocations, which is part of the invocation handling process.\n\n8. **Rank: 8**\n   - **Method ID:** 90\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:getMockSettings()Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/MockSettingsImpl;\n   - **Reason:** This method retrieves mock settings, which may include listener configurations.\n\n9. **Rank: 9**\n   - **Method ID:** 91\n   - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:pullVerificationMode()Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;\n   - **Reason:** This method pulls the verification mode, which is relevant to the verification process.\n\n10. **Rank: 10**\n    - **Method ID:** 41\n    - **Method Signature:** org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:resetOngoingStubbing()V\n    - **Reason:** This method resets ongoing stubbing, which could affect the invocation handling if not managed correctly.\n\nHere is the final ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
