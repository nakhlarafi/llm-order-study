    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `abstractMethodReturnsDefault`. The key points from the stack trace indicate that the failure is related to calling a real method on an abstract class, which is not allowed in Mockito.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this failure are:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`** - This method is directly mentioned in the exception thrown, indicating that it is responsible for reporting the error when an attempt is made to call a real method on an abstract class.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(...)`** - This method is involved in handling the invocation and is responsible for calling the real method, which in this case is failing because the method is abstract.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()`** - This method is part of the invocation process and is where the attempt to call the real method occurs.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.DefaultRealMethod:invoke(...)`** - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the target object, which is also relevant to the failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.cglib.MethodInterceptorFilter:intercept(...)`** - This method is part of the proxying mechanism and is involved in intercepting method calls, which is relevant in the context of mocking.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 73,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking, the methods that are directly involved in the error reporting and handling of the invocation of real methods on abstract classes are ranked higher due to their direct relevance to the test failure. The rest of the methods retain their previous ranks as they are less directly related to the failure."
