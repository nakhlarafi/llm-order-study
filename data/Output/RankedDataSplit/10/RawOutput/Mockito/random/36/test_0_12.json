    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods that were covered during the test execution. The test `shouldFailInRuntimeWhenCallingRealMethodOnInterface` indicates that there was a failure related to invoking a real method on a mock interface, which is a common scenario in Mockito.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurred while trying to invoke a method on a CGLIB proxy, specifically in the `CGLIBProxyRealMethod` and `FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod` classes. This suggests that these methods are highly relevant to the failure.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke** - This method is directly involved in invoking the real method on the proxy and is likely the most suspicious.\n2. **FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke** - This method wraps the invocation and handles exceptions, making it also very suspicious.\n3. **AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper** - This method is responsible for invoking the super method, which is crucial in the context of CGLIB proxies.\n4. **Invocation:callRealMethod** - This method is called in the test and is directly related to the failure.\n5. **StubbedInvocationMatcher:answer** - This method is involved in handling the invocation and could be relevant to the failure.\n6. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method checks if the invocation matches the expected behavior, which could be relevant in the context of mocking.\n7. **ArgumentsComparator:argumentsMatch** - This method compares arguments, which is important in the context of method invocation.\n8. **OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer** - This method is involved in setting up the answer for the mock, which is relevant to the test.\n9. **ThreadSafeMockingProgress:validateState** - This method ensures that the mocking state is valid, which could be relevant in a multi-threaded context.\n10. **CGLIBProxyRealMethod:<init>** - While this method is less suspicious than the invoke methods, it is still part of the CGLIB proxy mechanism.\n\nNow, let's present the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 202,  // Assuming this is the ID for Invocation:callRealMethod\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 108,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method IDs for `Invocation:callRealMethod` and other methods that were not previously listed need to be filled in with the correct IDs based on the actual implementation. The IDs provided here are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual IDs from the codebase."
