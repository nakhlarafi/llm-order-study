    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure and their relevance to the test case. The test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which indicates that the `InvocationMatcher` is likely involved in the stubbing process.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure and the new coverage information. The methods that are directly related to the invocation and stubbing process will be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Rank 1-8**: The top methods related to invocation and stubbing remain unchanged as they are still the most suspicious based on the previous analysis.\n- **Rank 9**: The `reset` method from `ThreadSafeMockingProgress` is added to the ranking as it is relevant to the test case that involves resetting mocks.\n- **Rank 10**: The `reset` method from `ArgumentMatcherStorageImpl` is also added as it is relevant to the handling of matchers during the stubbing process.\n\nThe other methods that were previously ranked lower have been adjusted based on their relevance to the current test case and the stack trace provided."
