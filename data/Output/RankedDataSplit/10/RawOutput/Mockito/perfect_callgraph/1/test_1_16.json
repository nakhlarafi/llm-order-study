    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods that were covered during the test execution. The test `test_stub_only_not_verifiable` encountered an `UnsupportedOperationException` at `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`, which indicates that the methods related to argument capturing and invocation handling are likely to be more suspicious.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure and the new coverage information. The methods that are directly involved in the invocation handling and argument capturing should be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 165,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 111,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Method ID 123** (`InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`) is now ranked highest because it directly caused the exception in the test.\n2. **Method ID 141** (`MockHandlerImpl.handle`) remains high due to its role in handling invocations.\n3. **Method ID 6** (`InvocationMatcher` constructor) is still relevant as it initializes the matcher.\n4. **Method ID 125** (`getMatchers`) is important for retrieving matchers, which is relevant to the invocation process.\n5. **Method ID 70** (`bindMatchers`) is now included as it relates to binding matchers to invocations.\n6. **Method ID 165** (`addAnswer`) is added to the ranking as it deals with adding answers to invocations, which is relevant to the stubbing process.\n7. The remaining methods retain their positions as they are still relevant but less directly connected to the failure observed in the test."
