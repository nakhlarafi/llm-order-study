    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test indicates that there is a `NoSuchMethodError` when trying to call a real method on an interface, which suggests that the method resolution is failing due to the way Mockito is handling the invocation of the real method.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this issue are those involved in the invocation of real methods and method proxies. Given the stack trace, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()`** - This method is directly involved in calling the real method on the mock, which is the source of the error.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()`** - This method is responsible for invoking the real method using CGLIB, which is likely where the method resolution is failing.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`** - This method checks if the method being invoked is void, which could be relevant if the method being called is expected to return a value.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper()`** - This method is involved in invoking the super method, which is part of the proxy mechanism.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validate()`** - This method validates the answer being returned, which could be relevant if the answer is not properly set up.\n\nGiven this analysis, we will adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failing test:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the methods that are directly involved in the invocation of real methods and method proxies have been prioritized based on their relevance to the observed failure."
