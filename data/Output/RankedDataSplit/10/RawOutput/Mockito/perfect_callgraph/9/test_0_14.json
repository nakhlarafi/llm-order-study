    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `CreatingMocksWithConstructorTest.testCallsRealInterfaceMethod`. The key points from the stack trace indicate that the failure is related to calling a real method on an abstract interface, which is not allowed.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this failure are those that deal with calling real methods and handling invocations. The previously ranked methods that are involved in this process are:\n\n1. `InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()`\n2. `CallsRealMethods:answer(InvocationOnMock)`\n3. `MockHandlerImpl:handle(Invocation)`\n\nGiven that the test is specifically about calling a real method on a mock, the methods that directly relate to this functionality should be ranked higher. The new methods covered in the stack trace do not seem to directly impact the failure, but they provide context for the invocation process.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 95,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 144,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The methods `InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()` and `CallsRealMethods:answer(InvocationOnMock)` remain at the top of the ranking as they are directly involved in the invocation process that led to the exception.\n- `MockHandlerImpl:handle(Invocation)` remains in the third position as it handles the invocation and is crucial in determining how the mock behaves.\n- The method `InvocationContainerImpl:hasAnswersForStubbing()` is added to the fourth position as it checks if there are answers for stubbing, which is relevant to the invocation process.\n- The rest of the methods retain their previous ranks as they are less directly related to the failure observed in the test."
