    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `handlesCustomProtocols` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically deals with the `Whitelist` class and its methods related to handling custom protocols for attributes in HTML tags.\n\nGiven that the test is focused on the `Whitelist` class, we should pay particular attention to the methods related to protocol handling and attribute validation. The previously ranked methods that are most relevant to this test are:\n\n1. `testValidProtocol` - This method is directly involved in validating protocols for attributes.\n2. `isSafeAttribute` - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which includes calling `testValidProtocol`.\n3. `addAttributes` - This method allows adding attributes to the whitelist, which is relevant since the test adds protocols to the `Whitelist`.\n4. `isSafeTag` - This method checks if a tag is safe, which is indirectly related but less critical than the others.\n\nThe new test coverage indicates that the `Whitelist` class is being exercised, particularly its methods for handling protocols. Therefore, we should elevate the ranks of the methods that are directly involved in this process.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The methods `testValidProtocol` and `isSafeAttribute` remain at the top of the ranking due to their direct involvement in protocol validation.\n- The `addAttributes` method is moved up to rank 3 as it is relevant to the test's functionality of adding protocols.\n- The `isSafeTag` method remains in rank 4 as it is still relevant but less critical than the others.\n- The `isFalse` method (ID 80) is added to the ranking as it was covered in the new test, indicating it may have some relevance, though it is less critical than the top methods.\n- The remaining methods retain their previous ranks as they are less directly related to the new test coverage."
