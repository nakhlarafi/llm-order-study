    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `handlesCustomProtocols` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically deals with handling custom protocols in the context of HTML cleaning, which suggests that methods related to protocol validation and attribute handling are more likely to be relevant.\n\n### Updated Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **testValidProtocol**: This method is directly related to validating protocols, which is central to the test case. It remains the most suspicious.\n2. **isSafeAttribute**: This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is also relevant to the handling of custom protocols. It remains highly suspicious.\n3. **clean**: This method is responsible for cleaning HTML, which is the main function being tested. It remains suspicious but slightly less so than the previous two.\n4. **addAttributes**: This method allows adding attributes to the whitelist, which could be relevant if custom protocols are being added. It remains suspicious.\n5. **addEnforcedAttribute**: Similar to `addAttributes`, this method deals with attributes but is less directly related to the test case. It remains in the ranking.\n6. **isSafeTag**: This method checks if a tag is safe, which is less relevant to the test case but still part of the overall safety checks. It remains in the ranking.\n7. **put**: This method adds an attribute to a collection, which is relevant but less so than the methods above. It remains in the ranking.\n8. **runParser**: This method is part of the parsing process but is less relevant to the specific test case. It remains in the ranking.\n9. **createTagPending**: This method is related to tag creation but is less relevant to the test case. It remains in the ranking.\n10. **isSelfClosing**: This method checks if a tag is self-closing, which is not directly relevant to the test case. It remains in the ranking.\n\n### Final Ranking\n\nGiven the analysis, the ranking remains largely the same, but we can confirm the relevance of the top methods based on the new test coverage.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and maintains the original order as the most suspicious methods remain relevant to the new test case."
