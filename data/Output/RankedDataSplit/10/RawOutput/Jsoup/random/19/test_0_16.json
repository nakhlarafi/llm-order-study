    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `handlesCustomProtocols` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically deals with custom protocols in the context of the `Whitelist` class, which suggests that methods related to protocol handling and attribute validation are likely to be more suspicious.\n\n### Updated Ranking Analysis\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `testValidProtocol` - This method is directly involved in validating protocols, which is central to the new test case. It remains the most suspicious.\n   \n2. **Rank 2**: `isSafeAttribute` - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is relevant to the handling of custom protocols. It remains in the second position.\n\n3. **Rank 3**: `addAttributes` - This method allows adding attributes to the whitelist, which is relevant to the test that adds custom protocols. It remains in the third position.\n\n4. **Rank 4**: `isSafeTag` - This method checks if a tag is safe, which is indirectly related to the test. It remains in the fourth position.\n\n5. **Rank 5**: `clean` - This method is responsible for cleaning HTML content, which is the main function being tested. It remains in the fifth position.\n\n6. **Rank 6**: `put` - This method adds an attribute to a collection, which is relevant but less directly related to the test. It remains in the sixth position.\n\n7. **Rank 7**: `runParser` - This method processes tokens, which is part of the overall parsing and cleaning process but is less directly related to the test. It remains in the seventh position.\n\n8. **Rank 8**: `createTagPending` - This method creates a pending tag, which is part of the parsing process but not directly related to the test. It remains in the eighth position.\n\n9. **Rank 9**: `isSelfClosing` - This method checks if a tag is self-closing, which is less relevant to the test. It remains in the ninth position.\n\n10. **Rank 10**: `equals` - This method checks equality for `TypedValue`, which is not relevant to the test. It remains in the tenth position.\n\n### Final Ranking\n\nThe final ranking remains unchanged as the new test does not introduce any new methods that would affect the existing rankings significantly. Here is the final output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
