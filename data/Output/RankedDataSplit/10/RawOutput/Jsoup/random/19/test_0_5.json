    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the test `org.jsoup.safety.CleanerTest.handlesCustomProtocols`. The test focuses on handling custom protocols in the `Whitelist` class, particularly in the context of cleaning HTML with specific attributes.\n\nGiven that the test is related to custom protocols and the `Whitelist` class, we should consider the methods that are directly involved in protocol handling and attribute validation. The previously ranked methods that are most relevant to this test are:\n\n1. `testValidProtocol` - This method is directly involved in validating protocols for attributes.\n2. `isSafeAttribute` - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is relevant when adding protocols.\n3. `addAttributes` - This method allows adding attributes to the whitelist, which is also relevant to the test.\n\nThe new coverage information does not directly affect the ranking of these methods, as they are still the most suspicious due to their involvement in protocol handling. However, we should also consider the newly covered methods and their relevance.\n\nThe newly covered methods are:\n- `Attributes:size()`\n- `Whitelist:isSafeTag()`\n- `TreeBuilder:currentElement()`\n- `Tag:getName()`\n- `TextNode:normaliseWhitespace()`\n- `TreeBuilder:process()`\n- `TreeBuilder:initialiseParse()`\n- `NodeTraversor:<init>()`\n- `Token$Character:<init>()`\n- `TreeBuilder:resetInsertionMode()`\n\nAmong these, `Whitelist:isSafeTag()` is relevant as it checks if a tag is safe, which could indirectly relate to the handling of attributes and protocols. However, it does not directly impact the protocol validation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ranking remains largely the same, but we can adjust the ranking slightly to reflect the new coverage. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, `Whitelist:isSafeTag()` is included as it is relevant to the context of the test, but the top three methods related to protocol handling remain the most suspicious."
