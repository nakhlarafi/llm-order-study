    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` specifically interacts with the `Whitelist` class and its methods, particularly focusing on the handling of custom protocols in attributes.\n\n### Analysis of Covered Methods:\n1. The test case indicates that the `testValidProtocol` method is likely to be involved since it checks the validity of protocols for attributes in the `Whitelist`.\n2. The `isSafeAttribute` method is also relevant as it checks if an attribute is safe based on the protocols defined in the `Whitelist`.\n3. The `addAttributes` method may also be indirectly involved since it allows adding attributes to the `Whitelist`, which could affect the outcome of the test.\n4. The other methods that were previously ranked lower do not seem to be directly related to the test case, as they do not deal with attributes or protocols.\n\n### Updated Ranking:\nGiven the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the test case:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `testValidProtocol` - Remains the most suspicious as it directly checks the validity of protocols.\n2. **Rank 2**: `isSafeAttribute` - Remains highly suspicious as it determines if an attribute is safe based on protocols.\n3. **Rank 3**: `addAttributes` - Remains relevant as it allows adding attributes, which could affect the test.\n4. **Rank 4**: `createTagPending` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n5. **Rank 5**: `runParser` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n6. **Rank 6**: `put` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n7. **Rank 7**: `isSelfClosing` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n8. **Rank 8**: `emitTagPending` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n9. **Rank 9**: `isTrue` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n10. **Rank 10**: `isFalse` - Remains unchanged as it is less relevant to the test.\n\n### Final Ranking in JSON Format:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the relevance of each method to the failing tests."
