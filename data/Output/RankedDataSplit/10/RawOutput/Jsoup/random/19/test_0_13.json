    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `handlesCustomProtocols` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically interacts with the `Whitelist` class, particularly the `addProtocols` method, which is now covered by the test. This suggests that the `addProtocols` method is likely to be more relevant to the failing tests.\n\nGiven this new information, we can adjust the rankings as follows:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `testValidProtocol` remains the most suspicious as it is still directly related to the validation of protocols.\n2. **Rank 2**: `isSafeAttribute` remains relevant as it calls `testValidProtocol`.\n3. **Rank 3**: `addProtocols` should be moved up in the ranking since it is now covered by the test and is directly related to the handling of protocols.\n4. **Rank 4**: `clean` remains relevant as it is the entry point for the cleaning process.\n5. **Rank 5**: `addAttributes` remains relevant but is less suspicious than the methods directly related to protocol handling.\n6. **Rank 6**: `isSafeTag` remains relevant but is less suspicious than methods that deal with attributes and protocols.\n7. **Rank 7**: `put` remains relevant but is less suspicious than the methods above.\n8. **Rank 8**: `runParser` remains relevant but is less suspicious than the methods above.\n9. **Rank 9**: `createTagPending` remains relevant but is less suspicious than the methods above.\n10. **Rank 10**: `isSelfClosing` remains relevant but is the least suspicious in this context.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 138,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the impact of the new test coverage on the methods."
