    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing tests and adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods accordingly. The newly covered methods do not directly affect the previously identified suspicious methods, but they do provide additional context for the test failures.\n\nThe previously ranked methods are still relevant, but we need to consider the new information to see if any adjustments are warranted. The methods that were covered in the new test do not seem to directly relate to the previously ranked methods, which are primarily focused on the handling of table elements in the HTML parsing process.\n\nGiven that the new test does not introduce any new failures or insights that would change the suspicion level of the previously ranked methods, we can retain the existing ranking.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 95,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the most suspicious methods based on the previous analysis and the new coverage information provided."
