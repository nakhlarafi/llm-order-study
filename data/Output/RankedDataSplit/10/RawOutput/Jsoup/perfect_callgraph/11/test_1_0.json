    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and stack trace, we can analyze the methods that are covered by the failing test. The test is focused on the `notClass` functionality of the `Selector` class in the Jsoup library, which involves parsing HTML and selecting elements based on CSS selectors.\n\nHere are the methods that are involved in the parsing and selection process, ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` - This method is directly responsible for parsing the HTML string, which is central to the test.\n2. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` - This method calls the parser method and is also crucial for the test.\n3. **Method ID: 6** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` - This method handles the actual parsing logic and is likely to be involved in any issues with parsing the HTML.\n4. **Method ID: 3** - `org.jsoup.nodes.Document:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - This constructor is called when creating a new Document object, which is part of the parsing process.\n5. **Method ID: 5** - `org.jsoup.parser.Tag:valueOf(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;` - This method is responsible for converting tag names into Tag objects, which is relevant for the selection process.\n6. **Method ID: 4** - `org.jsoup.nodes.Document:body()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` - This method retrieves the body of the document, which may be relevant depending on how the elements are structured.\n7. **Method ID: 2** - `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` - This method is used for validation and could potentially throw exceptions if null values are passed, which might be relevant in the parsing context.\n8. **Method ID: 7** - `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:isEmpty()Z` - This method checks if the token queue is empty, which is part of the parsing logic.\n9. **Method ID: 8** - `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:remainingLength()I` - This method calculates the remaining length of the token queue, which is also part of the parsing process.\n10. **Method ID: 9** - `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - This constructor initializes the token queue, but it is less likely to be the source of the issue compared to the other methods.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the ranked methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
