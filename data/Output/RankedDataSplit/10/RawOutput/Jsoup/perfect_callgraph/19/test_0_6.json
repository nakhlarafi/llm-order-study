    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` specifically interacts with the `addProtocols` method of the `Whitelist` class, which is already ranked as the most suspicious method. \n\nThe test indicates that the `addProtocols` method is being exercised, and since it is directly related to the handling of custom protocols, it remains highly suspicious. The other methods in the `Whitelist` class that are related to adding attributes or tags may also be relevant, but they are not directly invoked in this test.\n\nGiven that the `addProtocols` method is confirmed to be covered by the test, we will keep it at rank 1. The other methods will retain their previous ranks as they are not directly implicated by the new test coverage.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the current understanding of method coverage and their relevance to the failing tests."
