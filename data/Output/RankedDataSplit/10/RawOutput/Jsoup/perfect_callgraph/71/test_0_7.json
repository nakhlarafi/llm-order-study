    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, it appears that the tests are focused on the `org.jsoup.select.SelectorTest.splitOnBr` method, which is related to parsing HTML and handling elements. However, the covered methods listed do not directly relate to the `HtmlTreeBuilder` methods that were previously ranked.\n\nSince the new coverage information does not provide any new insights into the `HtmlTreeBuilder` methods, we will retain the existing ranking. The methods that were previously identified as suspicious remain unchanged, as there are no new failures or coverage that would suggest a need to adjust their rankings.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
