    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were previously ranked and see if any adjustments are warranted. The new test case `testInvalidTableContents` does not seem to directly cover any of the previously ranked methods related to table processing in the `HtmlTreeBuilderState`. Instead, it covers methods related to document output settings and entity handling.\n\nGiven that the new test does not provide additional coverage for the previously ranked methods, we will retain the existing ranking. However, we will note that the methods related to table processing remain suspicious due to their complexity and the nature of the test that was run.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 105,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 108,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the previous analysis and retains the order of suspicion based on the complexity and potential for errors in the methods related to table processing."
