    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The new test case does not seem to directly cover any of the previously ranked methods, which means their rankings remain unchanged. \n\nHowever, we should consider the context of the test and the methods that were covered. The covered methods are primarily related to the `LeafNode` and `TextNode` classes, which are not directly related to the `TokeniserState` methods that were previously ranked. \n\nSince there are no new insights that would change the suspicion levels of the previously ranked methods, we will retain the original ranking.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 203,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 204,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 200,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 201,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 202,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 205,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 191,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 192,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 193,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
