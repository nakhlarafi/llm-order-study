    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The new test case `testKeepsPreTextAtDepth` focuses on parsing HTML and retrieving text from nested elements, specifically within `<pre>` and `<code>` tags. \n\nThe covered methods from the stack trace are related to the `text()` method of an inner class of `Element`, which is not part of the previously ranked methods. Therefore, we need to assess how this new information affects the ranking of the existing methods.\n\nSince the new test does not directly cover any of the previously ranked methods, we will retain the existing rankings. However, we should consider that the methods related to handling elements and their text content might be indirectly affected by the new test, but without specific failures or coverage of the existing methods, we will keep the original ranking intact.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
