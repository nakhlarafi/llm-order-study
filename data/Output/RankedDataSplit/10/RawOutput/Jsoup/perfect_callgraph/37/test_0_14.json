    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest.testNotPretty` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically checks the behavior of the `prettyPrint` setting in the `Document` class, which directly affects the output of the HTML when pretty printing is enabled or disabled.\n\nGiven that the test interacts with the `prettyPrint` method in the `Document.OutputSettings` class, we can adjust the rankings of the methods accordingly. The methods related to `prettyPrint` are now more suspicious due to their direct involvement in the test case.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new observations:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 149,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Method ID 149** (`org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode:outerHtmlHead`) has been added to the ranking as it is now covered by the test and is relevant to the output when pretty printing is involved.\n- The other methods related to `prettyPrint` remain at the top of the ranking due to their direct involvement in the test case.\n- The rest of the methods retain their previous ranks as they were not directly affected by the new test coverage."
