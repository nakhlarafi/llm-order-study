    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing test `testCigarWithBoundaries`. The test appears to be related to the `CMAESOptimizer` class, which is already under scrutiny due to previous test failures. \n\nThe newly covered methods include `selectColumns`, `updateBD`, and several methods from the `Array2DRowRealMatrix` and `MatrixUtils` classes. The presence of these methods in the stack trace indicates that they may also be contributing to the issues observed in the tests.\n\nGiven this new information, we will adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods. The methods that are directly related to the optimization process and matrix manipulations are now more relevant, especially those that were covered in the failing test.\n\nHere is the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 132,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 131,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 130,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Rank 1 and 2**: The `doOptimize` and `initializeCMA` methods remain the most suspicious as they are central to the optimization process.\n2. **Rank 3 and 4**: The `selectColumns` and `updateBD` methods are now ranked higher due to their direct involvement in matrix operations that are critical to the optimizer's functionality.\n3. **Rank 5 and 6**: The `getGoalType` and `copyColumn` methods are still relevant but have been pushed down as they are less directly involved in the optimization logic.\n4. **Rank 7**: The `MersenneTwister` constructor remains relevant due to its role in random number generation.\n5. **Rank 8 and 9**: The `getUpper` and `getRowDimension` methods are now included as they were covered in the test and may influence the behavior of the optimizer.\n6. **Rank 10**: The `abs` method is included as it is a utility method that could be indirectly related to the calculations performed in the optimizer.\n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the methods that are most likely contributing to the test failures."
