    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the newly covered methods and their relevance to the failing test. The test `testCigarWithBoundaries` indicates that the methods involved in the optimization process, particularly those related to matrix operations and the CMAES algorithm, are critical to the functionality being tested.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods, taking into account the newly covered methods and their potential impact on the test failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 117,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 95,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Method ID 110 (`square`)** and **Method ID 117 (`max` with RealMatrix)** were added to the top ranks because they are now covered by the test and are likely involved in matrix operations that could affect the optimization process.\n2. The original top ranks (1, 2, 3, 4) remain unchanged as they are still highly relevant to the optimization logic.\n3. The remaining methods (5-10) retain their positions as they are less directly related to the immediate failure but still part of the overall optimization framework. \n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the importance of the newly covered methods in the context of the failing test."
