    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing test and their relevance to the issue at hand. The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` related to invalid endpoint parameters during the execution of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\nThe following methods are particularly relevant to the failure:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** (Method ID: 14) - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the exception is being thrown.\n2. **`getDomainLowerBound(D)D`** and **`getDomainUpperBound(D)D`** (Method IDs: 18 and 19) - These methods are used to determine the bounds for the bracketing process in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n3. **`bracket(UnivariateRealFunction, D, D, D)[D`** (Method ID: 16) - This method is called to find the bounds for the root-finding function, which is critical in the context of the exception being thrown.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the most suspicious methods. The methods that are directly involved in the failure should be ranked higher due to their direct impact on the test outcome.\n\nHere is the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the methods that are directly related to the failure of the test have been prioritized, reflecting their importance in diagnosing the issue. The original ranks of the other methods have been adjusted accordingly, with the most suspicious methods now at the top."
