    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the situation further. The test `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expects the mean of the provided scores to be `2.5`, but it is returning `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculation of the mean, which is primarily handled by the `Mean` class and its methods.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the stack trace, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **Mean Class**: The `Mean` class is directly involved in the calculation of the mean, and since the test is failing due to a `NaN` result, it is highly suspicious.\n2. **SummaryStatistics Class**: The `SummaryStatistics` class is responsible for managing the statistics, including the mean implementation. The method `setMeanImpl` is also relevant as it sets the mean implementation to the `Mean` class.\n3. **FirstMoment Class**: The `FirstMoment` class is involved in the calculation of the mean and is directly referenced in the stack trace.\n4. **SecondMoment Class**: This class is less directly related but still plays a role in the overall statistics calculations.\n5. **Sum Class**: The `Sum` class is used in the `Mean` class to calculate the sum of values, which is crucial for mean calculation.\n6. **SummaryStatistics:addValue**: This method is responsible for adding values to the statistics, which is essential for the mean calculation.\n7. **AbstractUnivariateStatistic:test**: This method is abstract and may not be directly related, but it is part of the hierarchy that includes the `Mean` class.\n8. **Increment Methods**: The increment methods for `Min`, `Max`, and `SumOfSquares` are less relevant but still part of the overall statistics management.\n9. **Constructor Methods**: The constructors for various classes are less likely to be the source of the issue since they are not involved in calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the updated ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the new observations and focuses on the methods that are most likely to be causing the failure in the test."
