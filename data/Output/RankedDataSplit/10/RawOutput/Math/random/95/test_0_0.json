    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test, stack trace, and covered methods, we need to analyze the context of the failure. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters when calling the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. This suggests that the issue likely originates from the parameters being passed to this method or the methods it relies on.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 3)** - This method is directly involved in the stack trace and is where the exception occurs. It is highly suspicious as it is the method being tested and is responsible for handling the input parameters.\n\n2. **`bracket` (Method ID: 4)** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is responsible for determining the bounds for the function. If it receives invalid parameters, it could lead to the exception seen.\n\n3. **`getInitialDomain` (Method ID: 2)** - This method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability` and is responsible for providing the initial domain based on the degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, it could lead to invalid bounds.\n\n4. **`getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 6)** - This method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is crucial for the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If this value is incorrect, it could lead to invalid calculations.\n\n5. **`getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 7)** - Similar to the previous method, this retrieves the numerator degrees of freedom. If this value is incorrect, it could also lead to issues in the calculations.\n\n6. **`cumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 8)** - This method is called in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability. If it returns an unexpected value, it could affect the subsequent calculations.\n\n7. **`getDomainUpperBound` (Method ID: 5)** - This method provides the upper bound for the domain. If it returns an incorrect value, it could lead to invalid parameters being passed to the `bracket` method.\n\n8. **`logGamma` (Method ID: 1)** - While not directly involved in the stack trace, this method is part of the calculations that may be used in the distribution functions. If it returns an unexpected value, it could indirectly affect the results.\n\n9. **`regularizedBeta` (Method ID: 0)** - This method is part of the calculations in the cumulative probability and could potentially lead to issues if it does not handle its inputs correctly.\n\n10. **Constructor of `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 7)** - The constructor initializes the degrees of freedom. If the values passed to it are incorrect, it could lead to issues in all methods that rely on these values.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranked list of methods in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
