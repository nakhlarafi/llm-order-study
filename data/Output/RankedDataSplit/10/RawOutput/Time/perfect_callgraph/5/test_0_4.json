    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods that were covered during the test. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_monthsWeeks` indicates that the `normalizedStandard` method is being called, which in turn calls the `withYears` method. The stack trace shows that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to set an indexed field, specifically in the `withYears` method.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure and the new coverage information. The `withYears` method remains highly suspicious due to the exception being thrown from it. The `normalizedStandard` method is also suspicious as it directly leads to the failure. The `setIndexedField` method is now more suspicious as it is the source of the exception.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **`withYears` (ID 14)** remains the most suspicious as it directly caused the exception.\n2. **`normalizedStandard` (ID 0)** is still very suspicious as it is the method that leads to the failure.\n3. **`setIndexedField` (ID 41)** is now ranked higher due to being the method that throws the exception.\n4. The other methods (`getMonths`, `getYears`, etc.) retain their previous ranks as they are less directly involved in the failure."
