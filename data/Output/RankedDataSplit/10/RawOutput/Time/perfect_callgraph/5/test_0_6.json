    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failing test. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_monthsWeeks` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown in the `setIndexedField` method of `PeriodType`. This indicates that the method is trying to access a field that is not supported, which is directly related to the `withYears` method as it is called within the `normalizedStandard` method.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.joda.time.Period:withYears(I)Lorg/joda/time/Period;` - This method is still the most suspicious as it is directly involved in the stack trace and is called from `normalizedStandard`.\n2. **Rank 2**: `org.joda.time.Period:normalizedStandard(Lorg/joda/time/PeriodType;)Lorg/joda/time/Period;` - This method is also directly involved in the failure and is responsible for calling `withYears`.\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.joda.time.PeriodType:setIndexedField(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePeriod;I[II)Z` - This method is where the exception is thrown, making it highly suspicious.\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.joda.time.Period:getMonths()I` - This method is called indirectly through `getIndexedField` in `normalizedStandard`, which is relevant to the test.\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.joda.time.Period:getYears()I` - Similar to `getMonths`, this method is also called indirectly and is relevant to the test.\n6. **Rank 6**: `org.joda.time.Period:getWeeks()I` - This method is also relevant as it is part of the `normalizedStandard` method's calculations.\n7. **Rank 7**: `org.joda.time.base.BasePeriod:setPeriodInternal(IIIIIIII)[I` - This method is involved in setting the period values and could be indirectly related to the issue.\n8. **Rank 8**: `org.joda.time.Period:getMillis()I` - This method is less suspicious but still part of the overall calculations in `normalizedStandard`.\n9. **Rank 9**: `org.joda.time.Period:getSeconds()I` - Similar to `getMillis`, this method is part of the calculations but less directly related to the failure.\n10. **Rank 10**: `org.joda.time.Period:getMinutes()I` - This method is the least suspicious as it is not directly involved in the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
