    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the `Fraction` class to determine their suspiciousness. The failing test indicates that there is an issue with the expected output of the `getReducedFraction` method, particularly when handling extreme values like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **getReducedFraction (ID: 1)**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is where the failure occurs. The test checks for the correct reduction of fractions, especially with extreme values, which is where the error arises.\n   \n2. **greatestCommonDivisor (ID: 0)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to simplify the fraction. If there is an issue with how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the fraction reduction.\n\n3. **getDenominator (ID: 2)**: This method retrieves the denominator of the fraction. If the denominator is not set correctly during the fraction creation, it could lead to incorrect assertions in the test.\n\n4. **getNumerator (ID: 3)**: Similar to `getDenominator`, this method retrieves the numerator. Any issues in setting the numerator correctly would also affect the test results.\n\n5. **Fraction Constructor (ID: 4)**: While this method is less directly related to the failure, if the constructor does not properly initialize the fraction's state, it could lead to issues in the other methods that rely on it.\n\nThe remaining methods are not included in the ranking as they are either not directly related to the test case or do not have a significant impact on the failure observed."
