    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the covered methods on the existing ranking of the most suspicious methods. The newly covered methods do not directly relate to the methods previously ranked, as they are utility methods and constructors that do not involve the main logic of the HTML parsing process.\n\nGiven that the previously ranked methods are still the most relevant to the failing tests, we will retain the existing ranking. However, we will ensure that the ranking reflects the latest observations, particularly focusing on the methods that are still suspicious based on their involvement in the parsing logic.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 97,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 96,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking maintains the original order as the newly covered methods do not affect the suspicion level of the existing methods involved in the parsing logic."
