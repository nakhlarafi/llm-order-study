    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the `notClass` test on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically checks the functionality of the `select` method in the `Selector` class, which is responsible for parsing and selecting elements based on the provided query.\n\nThe following observations can be made:\n\n1. The `select` method (Rank 1) is directly involved in the test, as it is called to perform the selection based on the query `\"div:not(.left)\"`. This method remains highly suspicious.\n2. The `Selector` constructor (Rank 2) is also relevant since it initializes the `Selector` object used in the `select` method. This method remains suspicious as well.\n3. The `consumeElementSelector` method (Rank 3) is likely involved in parsing the selector string, making it suspicious.\n4. The `byTag` method (Rank 6) is also relevant as it handles tag selection, which is part of the query parsing process.\n5. The `collect` method (Rank 5) is involved in gathering the selected elements, making it suspicious as well.\n\nGiven that the new test does not cover any of the methods that were previously ranked lower than Rank 6, we will adjust the rankings accordingly, moving the `byTag` method up in the rankings.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 115,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 127,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 116,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 108,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the relevance of the methods to the failing tests."
