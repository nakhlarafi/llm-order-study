    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, it appears that the new test case `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlParserTest.testInvalidTableContents` has covered some methods that were not previously included in the ranking. However, the methods covered in this test do not directly relate to the methods previously ranked based on their suspiciousness regarding the failing tests.\n\nSince the newly covered methods do not affect the existing methods related to the HTML parsing logic, the original ranking remains unchanged. The methods related to the `HtmlTreeBuilder` and its states are still the most suspicious based on the previous analysis.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 121,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 201,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 220,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 224,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 163,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 211,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 230,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 238,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
