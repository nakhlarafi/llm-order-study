    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the test `handlesCustomProtocols` on the previously ranked methods. The test specifically deals with the `Jsoup.clean` method and the `Whitelist` class, which suggests that methods related to protocol handling and attribute validation are likely to be more suspicious.\n\nThe previously ranked methods are as follows:\n\n1. `testValidProtocol`\n2. `isSafeAttribute`\n3. `addAttributes`\n4. `isSafeTag`\n5. `clean`\n6. `put`\n7. `runParser`\n8. `createTagPending`\n9. `isSelfClosing`\n10. `equals`\n\nGiven that the test directly interacts with the `clean` method and the `Whitelist` class, we should consider the following adjustments:\n\n- The `clean` method (Rank 5) is now more suspicious due to its direct involvement in the test.\n- The `testValidProtocol` (Rank 1) and `isSafeAttribute` (Rank 2) methods are still relevant, as they are involved in validating protocols and attributes.\n- The `addAttributes` method (Rank 3) is also relevant since it deals with adding protocols to the whitelist.\n- The `isSafeTag` method (Rank 4) remains relevant but may be slightly less suspicious compared to the others.\n- The `put` method (Rank 6) is less relevant in this context since it deals with adding attributes rather than protocols.\n\nThe new ranking will reflect the increased suspicion of the `clean` method and maintain the relevance of the protocol and attribute validation methods.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the increased suspicion of methods involved in the handling of protocols and attributes, particularly in the context of the new test coverage information."
