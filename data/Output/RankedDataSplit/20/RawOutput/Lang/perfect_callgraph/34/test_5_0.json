    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The test is failing because it expected a `null` value but received an empty map `{}`. This indicates that the issue likely lies in the handling of the registry in the `ToStringStyle` class.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 0 (`getRegistry`)**: This method is directly related to the failure since it returns the registry map that was expected to be `null` but was `{}`. This is the most suspicious method.\n2. **Method ID 1 (`isRegistered`)**: This method checks if a value is registered in the map returned by `getRegistry`. If `getRegistry` is faulty, this method's behavior will also be affected.\n3. **Method ID 10 (`append`)**: This method is involved in appending details to the string representation and may interact with the registry.\n4. **Method ID 16 (`appendEnd`)**: This method is responsible for finalizing the string representation and unregistering objects, which could be related to the empty map issue.\n5. **Method ID 12 (`toString`)**: This method constructs the string representation and may rely on the registry.\n6. **Method ID 13 (`reflectionToString`)**: Similar to method 12, it constructs the string representation and may also depend on the registry.\n7. **Method ID 3 (`toString` in ReflectionToStringBuilder)**: This method is part of the string construction process and could be indirectly related to the failure.\n8. **Method ID 4 (`toString` in ToStringBuilder)**: Similar to method 3, it is part of the string construction process.\n9. **Method ID 2 (`toString` in ReflectionToStringBuilder)**: This method is a higher-level method that calls other methods, making it less suspicious than the more direct methods.\n10. **Method ID 5 (`appendDetail`)**: This method appends details to the string but is less likely to be the cause of the failure compared to the others. \n\nThis ranking reflects the likelihood that each method is involved in the failure based on the stack trace and the nature of the test."
