    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the `Fraction` class to determine their suspiciousness. The test is failing due to an assertion error related to the expected and actual values of the numerator when calling `getReducedFraction`.\n\nHere are the methods that are covered in the test and their potential issues:\n\n1. **getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for reducing fractions. The failure in the test indicates that there might be a bug in how it handles certain inputs, particularly with extreme values or edge cases.\n\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)** - This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to simplify the fraction. If there is an issue with how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the reduced fraction.\n\n3. **getNumerator()** - This method is being tested directly in the assertions. If the numerator is not being set correctly in the `Fraction` object, it would lead to the test failure.\n\n4. **getDenominator()** - Similar to `getNumerator`, if the denominator is not set correctly, it could also contribute to the test failure.\n\n5. **Constructor of Fraction (int numerator, int denominator)** - If the constructor does not properly initialize the numerator and denominator, it could lead to incorrect values being returned by `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()`.\n\n6. **Handling of Integer.MIN_VALUE** - The test specifically checks for edge cases involving `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which could lead to overflow issues if not handled correctly in the `getReducedFraction` method.\n\n7. **ArithmeticException handling** - The test expects certain inputs to throw an `ArithmeticException`. If the method does not throw this exception when it should, it could indicate a problem.\n\n8. **Normalization of zero** - The method has a specific case for handling zero, which could be a source of error if not implemented correctly.\n\n9. **Reduction logic** - The logic for reducing fractions could have flaws, especially in how it handles negative values and zero denominators.\n\n10. **Edge case handling** - Any edge cases not covered in the test could also be a source of issues, particularly with negative values and large integers.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be causing the test failure based on the provided information."
