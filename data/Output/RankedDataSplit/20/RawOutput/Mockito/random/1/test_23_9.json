    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we need to reassess the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failing test and the stack trace. The test indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown, which is likely related to the handling of method invocations and argument capturing.\n\nGiven the stack trace and the methods involved, we can adjust the rankings as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationNotifierHandler:handle** - This method is directly involved in handling invocations and is the first point of failure in the stack trace. It is responsible for notifying method calls and handling exceptions, making it the most suspicious.\n   \n2. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is implicated in the stack trace as it is where the exception is thrown. It is crucial for capturing arguments for method invocations, which is directly related to the test case.\n\n3. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is also part of the stack trace and is responsible for handling mock invocations. Its failure could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n4. **NullResultGuardian.handle** - This method is involved in handling null results from mock invocations, which could be relevant to the test case.\n\n5. **InvocationContainerImpl:hasAnswersForStubbing** - This method checks if there are answers for stubbing, which is relevant to the invocation handling process.\n\n6. **InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer** - This method is responsible for adding answers to invocations, which is part of the stubbing process.\n\n7. **InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCall** - This method is responsible for notifying listeners of method calls, which is part of the invocation handling.\n\n8. **InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCallException** - This method handles exceptions during method calls, making it relevant to the failure.\n\n9. **MockingProgressImpl:pullOngoingStubbing** - This method is involved in managing ongoing stubbing, which could be related to the test case.\n\n10. **ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator** - Although not directly in the stack trace, it is the class being tested, and any issues in its instantiation process could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 109,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 256,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method IDs for `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`, `MockHandlerImpl.handle`, and `NullResultGuardian.handle` are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual IDs from your codebase."
