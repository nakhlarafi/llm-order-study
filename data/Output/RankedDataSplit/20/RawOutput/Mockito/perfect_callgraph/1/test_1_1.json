    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are now covered and their relevance to the failing test. The test `test_stub_only_not_verifiable` indicates that there is an issue with the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is likely related to the `InvocationMatcher` constructor.\n\nGiven that the stack trace points to `InvocationMatcher` and the test is about stubbing behavior, we can adjust the ranking of the methods accordingly. The methods that are directly related to the invocation and stubbing process will be considered more suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **InvocationMatcher Constructor** remains the most suspicious due to its direct involvement in the stack trace.\n2. **MockitoCore:when** and **MockitoCore:stub** methods are still relevant but have been moved down slightly as the focus is more on the invocation handling.\n3. **MockUtil:isMock** and **MockUtil:isMockitoMock** are still relevant but less so than the methods directly involved in stubbing and invocation.\n4. New methods related to validation and stubbing (`validateType`, `markStubUsed`) have been added to the ranking as they are now covered and could be relevant to the test's failure.\n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the methods that are most likely to be causing the issues in the test."
