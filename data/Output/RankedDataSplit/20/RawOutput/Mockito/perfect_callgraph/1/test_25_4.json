    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are potentially involved in the failure of the test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is likely related to the `InvocationMatcher` constructor.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher Constructor**: This method is still the most suspicious as it is directly involved in the stack trace.\n2. **MockingProgressImpl:stubbingStarted**: This method is also relevant as it is part of the stubbing process.\n3. **MockingProgressImpl:validateMostStuff**: This method is still relevant as it validates the state of the mocking progress.\n4. **MockingProgressImpl:resetOngoingStubbing**: This method is relevant as it resets the ongoing stubbing, which is part of the test.\n5. **MatchersBinder:bindMatchers**: This method is still relevant as it binds matchers to invocations.\n6. **MockitoCore:when**: This method is still relevant as it initiates the stubbing process.\n7. **MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted**: This method is relevant as it completes the stubbing process.\n8. **ThreadSafeMockingProgress:pullOngoingStubbing**: This method is relevant as it pulls the ongoing stubbing.\n9. **InvocationContainerImpl:resetInvocationForPotentialStubbing**: This method is relevant as it resets the invocation for potential stubbing.\n10. **Returns:returnsNull**: This method is less relevant but still part of the stubbing process.\n\nNow, let's update the ranking based on the new observations:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 69,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the relevance of each method to the failing test case."
