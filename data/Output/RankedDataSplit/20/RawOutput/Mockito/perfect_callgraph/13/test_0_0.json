The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and the stack trace, which indicates where the failure occurred.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 0 (handle)**: This method is directly involved in handling the invocation and is the core of the mocking framework, making it highly suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 1 (when)**: This method is responsible for setting up the stubbing, which is crucial for the test's behavior.\n3. **Method ID 3 (verify)**: This method is used to verify interactions with mocks, which is central to the test's purpose.\n4. **Method ID 10 (never)**: This method defines a verification mode that is being tested in the failing test, making it suspicious.\n5. **Method ID 4 (times)**: This method is related to the verification count, which is relevant to the test's assertions.\n6. **Method ID 5 (Times)**: This method constructs the verification mode, which is also relevant to the test.\n7. **Method ID 6 (Times constructor)**: This method initializes the verification mode, making it relevant to the test.\n8. **Method ID 11 (validateReturnValue)**: This method validates return values, which could be indirectly related to the failure.\n9. **Method ID 12 (getMethod)**: This method retrieves the method being invoked, which could be relevant in the context of the invocation.\n10. **Method ID 2 (stub)**: This method is involved in the stubbing process but is less directly related to the failure compared to the others."
