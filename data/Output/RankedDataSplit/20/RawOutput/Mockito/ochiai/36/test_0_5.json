    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The test is trying to call a real method on a mocked interface, which is not allowed, leading to a `NoSuchMethodError`. The methods that are most suspicious in this context are those that are involved in the invocation of the real method and the proxying mechanism.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n1. **Invocation:callRealMethod()**\n   - This method is directly involved in the invocation of the real method on the mock, which is the root cause of the failure.\n   \n2. **CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()**\n   - This method is responsible for invoking the super method on the CGLIB proxy, which is part of the mechanism that leads to the failure when trying to call a real method on an interface.\n\n3. **FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()**\n   - This method also plays a role in invoking the real method and includes error handling that may not be sufficient for this case.\n\n4. **AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper()**\n   - This method is involved in the invocation chain that leads to the failure, as it attempts to invoke the super method.\n\n5. **MockHandler:handle()**\n   - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and determining how to respond, which includes checking for stubbings and invoking the appropriate method.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 115,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
