    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, the following methods are most suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`** - This method is directly referenced in the stack trace and is responsible for throwing the exception when an attempt is made to call a real method on an abstract class. This is the primary cause of the failure.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(...)`** - This method is involved in the process of calling real methods on mocks. Since the test is trying to call a real method on an abstract class, this method is also suspicious.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(...)`** - This method handles the invocation of methods on mocks and is part of the call chain leading to the exception. It checks for answers for stubbing and is involved in the handling of the invocation.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.cglib.MethodInterceptorFilter:intercept(...)`** - This method is responsible for intercepting method calls on mocked objects. It plays a role in the invocation process and could be involved in the failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:processInjectMocks(...)`** - While not directly related to the exception, this method is part of the setup process for mocks and could be relevant in the context of how the mocks are being created and used in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
