    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The exception `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`, which is called by `MockHandlerImpl.handle`. This indicates that the methods related to handling invocations and argument capturing are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for handling invocations, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is also directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for capturing arguments, making it very suspicious.\n3. **NullResultGuardian.handle** - This method is part of the call chain and handles the result of the invocation, making it suspicious as well.\n4. **InvocationNotifierHandler.handle** - This method is also part of the call chain and is responsible for notifying method calls, making it suspicious.\n5. **VoidMethodStubbableImpl.toThrow** - This method is involved in stubbing void methods and is relevant to the test case, making it suspicious.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 195,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure and their roles in the invocation handling process."
