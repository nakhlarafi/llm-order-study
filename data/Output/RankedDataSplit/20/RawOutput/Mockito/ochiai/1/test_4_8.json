    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The stack trace indicates that the `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is part of the `InvocationMatcher` class. This suggests that the issue is likely related to how arguments are being captured or processed when calling the real method.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher** - This method is directly implicated in the stack trace, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl** - This method is also involved in handling the invocation, making it the second most suspicious.\n3. **InvocationNotifierHandler** - This method is part of the invocation handling chain, so it remains suspicious.\n4. **MockHandlerFactory** - This method creates the handler, which is part of the invocation process, so it stays in the ranking.\n5. **BaseStubbing:thenCallRealMethod** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for setting up the real method call, making it suspicious as well.\n\nThe other methods listed in the coverage information do not seem to be directly related to the failure based on the stack trace.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 66,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 176,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
