    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The exception `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which suggests that this method is likely related to the failure.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the rankings as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method is still highly suspicious as it is directly related to the matching of invocations.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl:handle** - This method is also highly relevant since it handles invocations and is part of the stack trace.\n3. **InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer** - This method is involved in adding answers to invocations, which is relevant to the stubbing process.\n4. **MatchersBinder:bindMatchers** - This method is involved in binding matchers to invocations, which is relevant to the matching process.\n5. **InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is now included in the top 5 as it is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely the cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method ID for `InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom` is assumed to be 123 based on its mention in the stack trace. If the actual ID is different, please replace it accordingly."
