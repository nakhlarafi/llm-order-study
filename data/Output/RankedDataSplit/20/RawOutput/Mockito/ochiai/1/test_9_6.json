    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is directly related to the `InvocationMatcher` class. This suggests that the methods related to invocation handling and argument capturing are the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method is still highly suspicious as it is directly involved in matching invocations.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl:handle** - This method is also very suspicious as it handles invocations and is part of the stack trace.\n3. **NullResultGuardian:handle** - This method is involved in handling the result of invocations and is part of the stack trace.\n4. **InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely the cause of the failure.\n5. **InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer** - This method is involved in adding answers to invocations and could be related to the stubbing behavior being tested.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure based on the stack trace and the context of the test."
