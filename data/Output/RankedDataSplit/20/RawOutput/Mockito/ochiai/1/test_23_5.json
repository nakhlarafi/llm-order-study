    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called during the handling of an invocation in the `MockHandlerImpl.handle` method. \n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method is still highly suspicious as it directly relates to the matching of invocations.\n2. **InvocationNotifierHandler:<init>** - This method is also suspicious as it initializes the handler that is involved in the invocation process.\n3. **MockHandlerImpl:handle** - This method is crucial as it handles the invocation and is directly involved in the failure.\n4. **InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is now added to the list as it is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is responsible for capturing arguments from the invocation.\n5. **ArgumentsComparator:argumentsMatch** - This method is still relevant as it deals with argument matching, which is a part of the invocation handling process.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure as indicated by the stack trace and the context of the test."
