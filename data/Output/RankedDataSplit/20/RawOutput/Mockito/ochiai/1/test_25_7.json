    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is directly related to the `InvocationMatcher` class. This suggests that methods related to invocation handling and argument capturing are more suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method is still highly suspicious as it is directly involved in matching invocations, which is central to the failure.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl:handle** - This method is also very suspicious as it handles invocations and is part of the stack trace.\n3. **InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer** - This method is relevant as it deals with adding answers to invocations, which could relate to the stubbing being reset.\n4. **InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is now included as it is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely the cause of the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n5. **MatchersBinder:bindMatchers** - This method is still relevant as it binds matchers to invocations, which is part of the invocation handling process.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the failure observed in the test case."
