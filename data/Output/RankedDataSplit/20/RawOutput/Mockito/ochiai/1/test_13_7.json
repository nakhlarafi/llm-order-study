    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure and their relevance to the test case. The test case indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` was thrown, which is linked to the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that the methods involved in the invocation handling and argument capturing are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly implicated in the exception thrown during the test.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and is closely related to the `InvocationMatcher`.\n3. **NullResultGuardian.handle** - This method is involved in handling the result of the invocation, which is part of the flow leading to the exception.\n4. **InvocationContainerImpl.findAnswerFor** - This method is involved in finding the appropriate answer for the invocation, which is relevant to the handling of the invocation.\n5. **MatchersBinder.bindMatchers** - This method is involved in binding matchers to invocations, which is part of the setup for the invocation handling.\n\nThe previous ranking remains relevant, but we will adjust the ranks based on the new information. Here is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure and their relevance to the test case."
