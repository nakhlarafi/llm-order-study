    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The `UnsupportedOperationException` indicates that there is an issue with capturing arguments in the `InvocationMatcher` class, which is directly related to the first method in the previous ranking.\n\nGiven the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher**: This method is still the most suspicious as the exception is thrown from within it.\n2. **InvocationNotifierHandler**: This method is involved in notifying method calls and could be related to the verification process.\n3. **DefaultRegisteredInvocations**: This method is responsible for adding invocations, which is relevant to the verification process.\n4. **MatchersBinder**: This method binds matchers to invocations, which is also relevant to the verification process.\n5. **MockScanner**: This method is involved in scanning for mocks, which could indirectly relate to the setup of the test.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 122,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the failure observed in the test case."
