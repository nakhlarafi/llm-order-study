    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The `UnsupportedOperationException` indicates that there is an issue with capturing arguments in the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause the failure. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher** - This method is directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for capturing arguments, which is where the exception is thrown.\n   - Method ID: 40\n   - Rank: 1\n\n2. **ArgumentsComparator** - This method is involved in matching arguments, which is closely related to the functionality of `InvocationMatcher`.\n   - Method ID: 8\n   - Rank: 2\n\n3. **InvocationNotifierHandler** - This method handles notifications related to method calls, which may be indirectly related to the failure.\n   - Method ID: 1\n   - Rank: 3\n\n4. **ArgumentsProcessor** - This method processes arguments into matchers, which is relevant to the argument capturing process.\n   - Method ID: 41\n   - Rank: 4\n\n5. **MockScanner** - This method is involved in scanning for mocks and may be relevant in the context of the test setup, but it is less directly related to the failure.\n   - Method ID: 120\n   - Rank: 5\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
