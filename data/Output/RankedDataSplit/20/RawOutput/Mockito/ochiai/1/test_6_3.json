    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is part of the `InvocationMatcher` class. This suggests that the methods related to `InvocationMatcher` are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely the cause of the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n2. **InvocationMatcher** constructor - This method is also involved in the creation of the `InvocationMatcher` instance, which is relevant to the failure.\n3. **InvocationMatcher.getMatchers** - This method retrieves the matchers, which may be involved in the verification process.\n4. **MatchersBinder.bindMatchers** - This method binds matchers to an invocation, which is relevant to the verification process.\n5. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method handles the invocation and is part of the call chain leading to the failure.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method ID for `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` is assumed to be 123 based on its mention in the stack trace. If the actual ID is different, please replace it accordingly."
