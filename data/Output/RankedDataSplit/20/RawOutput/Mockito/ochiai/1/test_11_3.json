    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that the methods related to argument matching and invocation handling are more suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher**: The constructor and methods related to argument capturing and matching are critical in this context, especially since the failure is related to capturing arguments.\n2. **DefaultRegisteredInvocations**: This method is involved in adding invocations, which is relevant to the verification process.\n3. **ArgumentsComparator**: This method checks if the arguments match, which is directly related to the verification process.\n4. **InvocationNotifierHandler**: This method is involved in notifying listeners of invocations, which is relevant to the handling of method calls.\n5. **MockHandlerImpl**: This method is responsible for handling mock settings and could be involved in the creation and management of mocks.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure based on the stack trace and the context of the test."
