    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `shouldStubBooleanVarargs`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called by `MockHandlerImpl.handle`. \n\nGiven the context of the test and the stack trace, we can rank the methods as follows:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher:matches** - This method is responsible for matching invocations, and since the failure occurs during argument capturing, it is highly suspicious.\n2. **InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor** - This method is involved in finding the appropriate answer for a given invocation, which is crucial in the context of stubbing.\n3. **MockHandlerImpl:handle** - This method handles the invocation and is directly involved in the process that leads to the exception.\n4. **InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is where the exception is thrown, making it very suspicious.\n5. **ArgumentsComparator:varArgsMatch** - This method deals with matching variable arguments, which is relevant to the test case.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 59,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure and their relevance to the test case."
