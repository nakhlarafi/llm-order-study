    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure. The exception `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`, which indicates that the issue is likely related to how arguments are being captured during the invocation handling process.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure:\n\n1. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is directly involved in handling the invocation and is where the exception is propagated from.\n2. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is the source of the exception, making it highly suspicious.\n3. **NullResultGuardian.handle** - This method wraps the call to `MockHandlerImpl.handle`, so it is also relevant to the failure.\n4. **InvocationNotifierHandler.handle** - This method is involved in notifying the invocation and is part of the chain leading to the exception.\n5. **InvocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing** - This method is less directly related to the failure but is part of the invocation handling process.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method ID for `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` is assumed to be 123 based on its context in the stack trace. If the actual ID is different, please replace it accordingly."
