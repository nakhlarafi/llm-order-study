    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the situation further. The exception `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the method `readFilesInfo` in the `SevenZFile` class is likely the source of the problem, as it is responsible for reading file properties and is where the exception is thrown.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failing test. The methods that are directly involved in reading and writing file information are more suspicious. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n1. **Method Signature:** `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`  \n   **Reason:** This method is directly responsible for reading file properties and is where the exception is thrown.  \n   **Method ID:** 36\n\n2. **Method Signature:** `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`  \n   **Reason:** This method reads stream information, which is closely related to the properties being read in `readFilesInfo`.  \n   **Method ID:** 35\n\n3. **Method Signature:** `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V`  \n   **Reason:** This method writes file information, and if there is a mismatch in the expected properties, it could lead to issues when reading them back.  \n   **Method ID:** 22\n\n4. **Method Signature:** `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V`  \n   **Reason:** Similar to `writeFilesInfo`, this method writes stream information, which is relevant to the properties being read.  \n   **Method ID:** 20\n\n5. **Method Signature:** `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeSubStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V`  \n   **Reason:** This method writes sub-stream information, which may also be related to the properties being read and could contribute to the issue.  \n   **Method ID:** 21\n\nHere\u2019s the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
