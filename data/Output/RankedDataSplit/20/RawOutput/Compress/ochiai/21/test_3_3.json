    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the test coverage information, the method that is most suspicious is `readFilesInfo`, as it directly throws the `IOException` with the message \"Unknown property 128\". This indicates that the method is likely not handling certain input values correctly, leading to the failure of the test.\n\nThe previous ranking remains relevant, but we will adjust the ranking based on the new information. Here\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `readFilesInfo` (method_id: 36) remains the most suspicious due to the direct exception thrown.\n- `readHeaders` (method_id: 35) is next, as it is called by `readFilesInfo`.\n- The other methods are ranked based on their relevance to the flow of execution leading to the failure."
