    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the situation further. The exception `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the issue arises when the method `readFilesInfo` attempts to read a property type that it does not recognize.\n\nGiven this context, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V` - This method is directly involved in reading the file information and is where the exception is thrown. It is highly suspicious.\n   \n2. **Rank 2**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V` - This method is responsible for reading stream information, which is closely related to the properties being read in `readFilesInfo`. It may also contribute to the issue.\n\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readSubStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V` - This method is involved in reading sub-stream information, which could also be relevant to the properties being processed.\n\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V` - This method is responsible for writing file information. If the writing process does not align with the reading process, it could lead to inconsistencies.\n\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V` - Similar to `writeFilesInfo`, this method writes stream information and could also contribute to the issue if there is a mismatch in the expected properties.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the failure and their potential to cause the observed exception."
