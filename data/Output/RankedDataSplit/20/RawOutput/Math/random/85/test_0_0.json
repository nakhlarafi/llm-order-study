The ranking is based on their involvement in the stack trace and the context of the failure in the test case.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 10**: `inverseCumulativeProbability(D)` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is directly involved in the test and is where the failure occurs.\n2. **Method ID 9**: `inverseCumulativeProbability(D)` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` is called by the method in `NormalDistributionImpl`, making it highly relevant.\n3. **Method ID 3**: `cumulativeProbability(D)` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, contributing to the failure.\n4. **Method ID 4**: The catch block for `MaxIterationsExceededException` indicates that this method is involved in handling convergence issues, which is relevant to the failure.\n5. **Method ID 13**: `bracket` method in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` is responsible for finding bounds for the root-finding function, which is critical in the context of convergence.\n6. **Method ID 1**: `getStandardDeviation()` is part of the distribution calculations and could indirectly affect the results.\n7. **Method ID 12**: `getDomainLowerBound(D)` is used to determine the bounds for the probability, which is relevant to the calculations.\n8. **Method ID 18**: `getDomainUpperBound(D)` is also involved in determining bounds, making it relevant.\n9. **Method ID 0**: `setMean(D)` is less directly involved but still part of the distribution setup.\n10. **Method ID 5**: `erf(D)` is part of the calculations but is less directly related to the failure in the test case. \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the failure and their roles in the computation leading to the exception."
