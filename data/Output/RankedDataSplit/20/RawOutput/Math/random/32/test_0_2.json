    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered during the test execution. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `computeGeometricalProperties` method of the `PolyhedronsSet` class, which is directly related to the `computeGeometricalProperties` method that was previously ranked second.\n\nGiven that the failure is linked to the `computeGeometricalProperties` method and the `PolyhedronsSet` class, we can adjust the rankings accordingly. The methods that are directly involved in the failure should be ranked higher due to their relevance to the issue.\n\nHere is the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Rank 1**: The `computeGeometricalProperties` method is now ranked first due to its direct involvement in the failure.\n2. **Rank 2**: The `FacetsContributionVisitor` constructor is ranked second as it is part of the `PolyhedronsSet` and is involved in the computation of geometrical properties.\n3. **Rank 3**: The `Line` constructor remains in the top ranks due to its previous suspicion.\n4. **Rank 4**: The `side` method remains relevant as it is part of the geometry partitioning.\n5. **Rank 5**: The `split` method is still relevant due to its involvement in geometric operations.\n6. **Rank 6**: The `Plane` constructor remains relevant.\n7. **Rank 7**: The `insertCuts` method remains relevant.\n8. **Rank 8**: The `intersection` method remains relevant.\n9. **Rank 9**: The `getAngle` method is included due to its potential involvement in angle calculations.\n10. **Rank 10**: The `SegmentsBuilder` constructor remains in the list.\n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the direct connection to the failing test case."
