    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the newly covered methods and their relevance to the failing test. The test `CMAESOptimizerTest.testTablet` indicates that the failure is likely related to the optimization process, particularly in the `CMAESOptimizer` class.\n\nGiven the new data, we will update the ranking of the most suspicious methods. The methods that were previously ranked high, particularly those involved in the optimization process, will remain at the top. However, we will also consider the newly covered methods that are directly related to the optimization logic.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 121,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 118,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Method ID 125 (`sortedIndices`)**: This method is now ranked higher because it is directly involved in sorting fitness values, which is crucial for the optimization process.\n2. **Method ID 121 (`copyColumn`)**: This method is also relevant as it deals with copying columns in matrices, which may be involved in the optimization logic.\n3. **Method ID 136 (`updateBD`)**: This method is related to updating the covariance matrix, which is a critical part of the CMA-ES algorithm.\n4. **Method ID 134 (`selectColumns`)**: This method is involved in selecting columns from matrices, which is important for the optimization process.\n\nThe rest of the methods retain their previous ranks as they are still relevant but less directly involved in the specific failure observed in the test."
