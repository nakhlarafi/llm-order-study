The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and the potential for causing the assertion failure.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 0**: The `optimize` method is directly involved in the optimization process and is the primary method being tested. Any issues here could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **Method ID 14**: This method is responsible for the core optimization logic (Brent's method). If there are inaccuracies in the calculations, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n3. **Method ID 1**: The constructor for `BrentOptimizer` sets the relative and absolute tolerances, which are critical for determining convergence and accuracy.\n4. **Method ID 8**: This method computes the objective value, which is essential for the optimization process. Any errors here could directly affect the results.\n5. **Method ID 6**: This method is another `optimize` method that is called within the main `optimize` method. It could also contribute to inaccuracies.\n6. **Method ID 4**: The sorting of pairs based on the goal type could affect the final output if not handled correctly.\n7. **Method ID 3**: The `max` function is used in the optimization process, and any inaccuracies could lead to incorrect bounds.\n8. **Method ID 2**: The `min` function is similarly important for determining bounds and could affect the optimization results.\n9. **Method ID 7**: This method retrieves the point from the result, which is less likely to cause the failure but still relevant.\n10. **Method ID 10**: This method retrieves the goal type, which is less likely to be the source of the failure but is still part of the overall process."
