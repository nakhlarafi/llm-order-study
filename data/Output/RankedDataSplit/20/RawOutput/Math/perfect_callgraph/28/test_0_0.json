The ranking is primarily based on their involvement in the stack trace and their relevance to the failure of the test case.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **SimplexSolver Constructor (`method_id`: 1)**: Directly involved in the instantiation of the `SimplexSolver`, which is critical to the optimization process.\n2. **SimplexSolver Constructor with Parameters (`method_id`: 2)**: Also directly related to the setup of the `SimplexSolver`, influencing its behavior.\n3. **AbstractLinearOptimizer Constructor (`method_id`: 3)**: This method sets the maximum iterations, which is relevant to the `MaxCountExceededException`.\n4. **getPivotRow (`method_id`: 0)**: This method is part of the optimization process and could be involved in the iteration logic.\n5. **isOptimal (`method_id`: 9)**: This method checks if the current solution is optimal, which is relevant to the optimization process.\n6. **normalizeConstraints (`method_id`: 8)**: This method normalizes constraints, which is essential for the optimization process.\n7. **setMaxIterations (`method_id`: 11)**: This method sets the maximum iterations, which is directly related to the exception thrown.\n8. **getNumObjectiveFunctions (`method_id`: 13)**: This method retrieves the number of objective functions, which is relevant to the optimization logic.\n9. **Array2DRowRealMatrix Constructor (`method_id`: 12)**: While not directly related to the failure, it is part of the data structures used in optimization.\n10. **Precision.equals (`method_id`: 4)**: This method is used for comparing floating-point numbers, which is less likely to be the cause of the failure but still relevant in the context of numerical stability."
