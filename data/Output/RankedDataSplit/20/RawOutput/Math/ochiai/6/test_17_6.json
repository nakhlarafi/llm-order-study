    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided coverage information and the previously ranked methods, I will analyze the new test case and its stack trace to determine if any methods should be re-ranked or if the previous ranking remains valid.\n\nThe test case `testCigarWithBoundaries` is designed to test the `CMAESOptimizer` class, specifically focusing on the optimization process with boundaries. The stack trace indicates that an assertion failed during the test, which suggests that the output of the optimization did not meet the expected criteria.\n\nThe previously ranked methods are as follows:\n\n1. `doOptimize()`\n2. `optimize(OptimizationData...)`\n3. `parseOptimizationData(OptimizationData...)`\n4. `FitnessFunction:value(double[])`\n5. `FitnessFunction:repair(double[])`\n\nGiven that the test is related to the optimization process, the most suspicious methods are likely to be those involved in the optimization logic, particularly `doOptimize()` and `optimize()`. The `FitnessFunction` methods are also relevant since they directly affect the evaluation of the optimization.\n\nThe new coverage information does not introduce any new methods that are directly related to the optimization process in `CMAESOptimizer`. The methods covered in the stack trace are primarily related to matrix operations and utility functions, which are less likely to be the source of the failure.\n\nTherefore, the previous ranking remains valid, as the methods involved in the optimization process are still the most suspicious. Here is the final ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
