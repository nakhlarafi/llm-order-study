    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided coverage information and the previous ranking of methods, we can analyze the new test case and its stack trace to determine if any methods should be re-ranked or if the previous ranking remains valid.\n\nThe test case `CMAESOptimizerTest.testTablet` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected outcome of the test did not match the actual result. The stack trace points to the `doTest` method, which likely involves the optimization process.\n\nThe methods that are covered by this test case do not directly relate to the optimization logic of the `CMAESOptimizer`, but rather to matrix operations and random number generation. However, since the test is related to the optimization process, we should still consider the methods involved in the optimization logic.\n\nGiven the previous ranking, we will maintain the focus on the methods that are directly involved in the optimization process. The methods that were previously ranked are:\n\n1. `doOptimize()`\n2. `optimize()`\n3. `parseOptimizationData()`\n4. `FitnessFunction:value()`\n5. `BaseMultivariateOptimizer:optimize()`\n\nSince the test case is related to the optimization process, we will keep the previous ranking intact as the most suspicious methods are still relevant to the failure.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 83,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
