    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge`. The test expects a `NumberIsTooLargeException` but instead encounters a `MathIllegalStateException`. This indicates that the issue likely lies in the handling of boundary conditions or the state of the optimizer.\n\nGiven the previous rankings and the new information, we can adjust the rankings as follows:\n\n1. **CMAESOptimizer:doOptimize()** - This method is directly involved in the optimization process and is where the exception is thrown. It is crucial to the test's outcome.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters()** - This method checks the parameters, including bounds, which are critical in this test case. If the bounds are not handled correctly, it could lead to the wrong exception being thrown.\n3. **BaseAbstractMultivariateOptimizer:computeObjectiveValue()** - This method is called during the optimization process and is where the fitness function is evaluated. If the fitness function encounters an illegal state, it could lead to the observed exception.\n4. **BaseAbstractMultivariateOptimizer:optimizeInternal()** - This method orchestrates the optimization process and calls `doOptimize()`. It is important for the flow of execution leading to the exception.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:value()** - This method is part of the fitness function and is where the actual computation occurs. If it encounters an illegal state, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 958,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method ID for `CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:value()` is assumed to be 958 based on the context provided, as it was not explicitly listed in the previous information. Adjust the ID accordingly if it is different."
