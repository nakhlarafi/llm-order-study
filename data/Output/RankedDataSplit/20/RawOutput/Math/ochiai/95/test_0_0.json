    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the context of the error and the methods involved in the call stack.\n\nThe error message indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid endpoint parameters in the `bracket` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`. This suggests that the parameters being passed to this method are not valid, which could be due to incorrect values being calculated or returned by the methods leading up to this call.\n\nHere are the methods involved in the stack trace and their relevance:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** (Method ID: 3) - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the error originates. It calls the `bracket` method, making it highly suspicious.\n\n2. **`getDomainLowerBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 0) - This method returns a constant value of `0.0`, which is used in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. If the logic in `inverseCumulativeProbability` is incorrect, it could lead to invalid parameters being passed to `bracket`.\n\n3. **`getDomainUpperBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 1) - Similar to `getDomainLowerBound`, this method returns `Double.MAX_VALUE`. If the upper bound is not set correctly in the context of the calculations, it could also lead to invalid parameters.\n\n4. **`getInitialDomain(double p)`** (Method ID: 2) - This method calculates an initial domain based on the degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, it could lead to an invalid initial value being passed to `bracket`.\n\n5. **`setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** (Method ID: 8) - This method sets the denominator degrees of freedom. If it is called with an invalid value (e.g., less than or equal to zero), it could lead to issues in the calculations that follow.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the most suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to contribute to the failure of the test based on the stack trace and the nature of the error encountered."
