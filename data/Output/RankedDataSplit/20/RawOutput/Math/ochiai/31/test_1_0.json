    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test, stack trace, and covered methods, we need to consider the context of the failing test. The test is specifically checking the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class, which is likely to be the root cause of the failure. \n\nThe methods that are directly involved in the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability or are closely related to it will be ranked higher in suspicion. Here\u2019s the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 17**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` - This is the method being tested directly, and since the test is failing due to its inability to calculate the probability, it is the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 8**: `cumulativeProbability` - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to compute the cumulative probability, making it highly relevant to the failure.\n3. **Method ID 18**: `UnivariateSolverUtils:solve` - This method is used to find the root of the function defined in `inverseCumulativeProbability`, which is critical for its operation.\n4. **Method ID 4**: `calculateNumericalVariance` - Variance is a key statistical measure that could affect the calculations in the distribution, and if it is incorrectly calculated, it could lead to failures in the inverse cumulative probability.\n5. **Method ID 3**: `getNumericalVariance` - Similar to the previous method, this method retrieves the variance, which is essential for the distribution calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
