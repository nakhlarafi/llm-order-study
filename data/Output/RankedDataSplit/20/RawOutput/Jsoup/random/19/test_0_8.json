    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` indicates that the `Whitelist` class and its methods are being exercised, particularly in relation to handling custom protocols for attributes. \n\nGiven that the test is focused on the `clean` method and the `addProtocols` method of the `Whitelist`, we should consider the following:\n\n1. **`isSafeAttribute`** and **`testValidProtocol`** are still highly relevant since they deal with attribute validation and protocol checking, which are critical in the context of the test.\n2. The `addProtocols` method (not previously listed) is likely to be important as it directly relates to the test's functionality.\n3. The `clean` method is also crucial as it orchestrates the cleaning process, which is the main focus of the test.\n\nGiven this analysis, we will adjust the rankings to reflect the new insights:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 145,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 146,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 142,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 160,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Rank 1 and 2** remain unchanged as `isSafeAttribute` and `testValidProtocol` are still the most suspicious methods.\n- **Rank 3** is now `addProtocols` (ID 160), which is crucial for the test's functionality but was not previously listed.\n- **Rank 4** is now `clean` (ID 107), which is the main method being tested.\n- The rest of the methods retain their previous ranks as they are still relevant but less directly impacted by the new test coverage."
