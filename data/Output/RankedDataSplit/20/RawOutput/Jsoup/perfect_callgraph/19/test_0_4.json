    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` specifically interacts with the `addProtocols` method, which is already ranked as the most suspicious. This method is directly involved in adding protocols for the `img` tag, which is crucial for the test's success.\n\nThe other methods in the `Whitelist` class, particularly `testValidProtocol`, are also relevant since they validate the protocols added. However, since the test primarily focuses on the `addProtocols` method, it reinforces the suspicion around that method.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the rankings slightly, but the top methods remain largely the same. Here\u2019s the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the most suspicious methods remain the same, as the test directly validates the functionality of `addProtocols` and indirectly tests `testValidProtocol`. The other methods do not show any significant changes in their relevance based on the new test coverage information."
