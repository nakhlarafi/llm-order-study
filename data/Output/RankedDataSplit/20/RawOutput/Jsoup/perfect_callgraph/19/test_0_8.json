    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact on the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` specifically interacts with the `addProtocols` method, which is already ranked as the most suspicious. This method is directly involved in the test case, indicating that it is likely to be a source of issues if the test fails.\n\nThe `testValidProtocol` method is also relevant since it checks the validity of protocols, but it is not directly invoked in the new test case. The other methods, particularly those related to the initialization and basic functionality of the `Whitelist`, are less likely to be the source of the problem since they are not directly involved in the test case.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ranking of the methods will be updated as follows:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `addProtocols` remains the most suspicious as it is directly tested.\n2. **Rank 2**: `testValidProtocol` remains relevant but is less suspicious than `addProtocols`.\n3. **Rank 3**: `isSafeTag` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the test.\n4. **Rank 4**: `basicWithImages` remains unchanged.\n5. **Rank 5**: `basic` remains unchanged.\n6. **Rank 6**: `addTags` remains unchanged.\n7. **Rank 7**: `init` remains unchanged.\n8. **Rank 8**: `AttributeKey` remains unchanged.\n9. **Rank 9**: `notNull` remains unchanged.\n10. **Rank 10**: `notEmpty` remains unchanged.\n\nSince the new test case does not introduce any new methods that would change the ranking, the final ranking remains the same.\n\nHere is the final output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
