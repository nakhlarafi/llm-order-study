    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the newly covered methods and their relevance to the previously ranked methods. The new tests cover methods related to text nodes and query parsing, which may not directly impact the previously identified suspicious methods in the `Tokeniser` class. However, we should consider the implications of the new coverage on the existing rankings.\n\nThe previously ranked methods are primarily focused on the tokenization process, which is crucial for parsing HTML. The new methods covered do not seem to directly relate to the tokenization process but rather to the handling of text nodes and selectors.\n\nGiven that the new methods do not introduce any significant changes to the tokenization logic or the methods that were previously ranked, we can retain the existing rankings. However, we will add the newly covered methods to the list and rank them based on their relevance and potential impact on the parsing process.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 160,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 161,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 180,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 167,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 169,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 164,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 200,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the methods related to text nodes (`nodeName`, `getWholeText`, `isBlank`, etc.) are added to the list, but they are ranked lower than the methods related to tokenization, which remain the most suspicious based on the context of the failing tests."
