    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were previously ranked and see if any adjustments are warranted. The test `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest.testNotPretty` primarily interacts with the `Document` and `Element` classes, which may not directly affect the methods in the `HtmlTreeBuilder` class that were previously ranked.\n\nHowever, since the test involves parsing HTML and manipulating elements, it may indirectly affect the methods related to parsing and element insertion. The methods that were previously ranked are still relevant, but we need to consider if any new methods from the coverage information should be included in the ranking.\n\nThe methods covered in the new test do not seem to directly relate to the `HtmlTreeBuilder` methods that were previously ranked. Therefore, we will retain the existing ranking as it is, since the new coverage does not provide evidence to change the suspicion levels of the previously ranked methods.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
