    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, it appears that the test `testInvalidTableContents` is failing due to an assertion that checks the order of certain text elements in the rendered output. The failure indicates that the expected order of elements is not being maintained, which suggests that the methods responsible for processing table elements and their contents are likely involved.\n\nGiven the previous ranking of methods and the new coverage information, we can analyze the methods that are most likely related to the handling of table elements and their structure. The methods that were previously ranked are primarily focused on table processing, which aligns with the context of the failing test.\n\nHere is the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods, considering the new coverage information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 105,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThe previous ranking remains unchanged as the methods involved in processing table elements are still the most suspicious given the context of the test failure. The new coverage information does not introduce any methods that would take precedence over the existing rankings related to table processing."
