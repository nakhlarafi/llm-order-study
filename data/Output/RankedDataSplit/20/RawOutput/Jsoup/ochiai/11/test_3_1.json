    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the failing test, we can analyze the situation further. The test `notParas` is failing due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse the query `p:not([id=1])`. This indicates that the parsing logic for selectors, particularly the handling of the `:not` pseudo-class, is likely at fault.\n\nGiven the context, we should focus on methods related to parsing selectors and handling the `TokenQueue`, as these are directly involved in the parsing process. \n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the most suspicious methods based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 23 (`consumeElementSelector`)**: This method is responsible for consuming element selectors, which is directly related to the parsing of the `:not` pseudo-class.\n2. **Method ID 20 (`chompTo`)**: This method is involved in consuming characters until a specified sequence is found, which is crucial for parsing complex selectors.\n3. **Method ID 22 (`consumeTo`)**: Similar to `chompTo`, this method consumes characters until a sequence is found, and it may play a role in how selectors are processed.\n4. **Method ID 24 (`byTag`)**: This method handles tag selection, which is relevant when parsing selectors that include tags.\n5. **Method ID 5 (`select`)**: This method is part of the selection process and is indirectly related to the parsing logic, making it still relevant but less suspicious than the others.\n\nThe previous ranking of methods remains relevant, but the focus has shifted to methods that are more directly involved in parsing selectors, especially given the nature of the failure."
