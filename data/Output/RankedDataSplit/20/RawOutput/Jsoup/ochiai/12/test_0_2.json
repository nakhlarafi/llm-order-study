    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, it appears that the failure is occurring in the `findElements` method of the `Selector` class due to an unexpected token in the query. This suggests that the parsing logic in the `findElements` method is not handling the input correctly.\n\nGiven this context, I will update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure and the provided stack trace. The methods that are directly involved in parsing the query and handling the selection logic will be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 28 (`findElements`)**: This method is directly responsible for parsing the query and is where the exception is thrown. It is the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 27 (`select`)**: This method calls `findElements` and is involved in the selection process, making it the second most suspicious.\n3. **Method ID 26 (`select(String, Element)`)**: This method creates a new `Selector` and calls `select`, which in turn calls `findElements`. It is relevant but less suspicious than the previous two.\n4. **Method ID 24 (`Selector(String, Element)`)**: This constructor initializes the `Selector` and sets up the query. It is less suspicious than the methods that handle the selection logic.\n5. **Method ID 25 (`<clinit>()`)**: This static initializer is the least suspicious as it only initializes static variables and does not involve any logic related to query parsing or selection."
