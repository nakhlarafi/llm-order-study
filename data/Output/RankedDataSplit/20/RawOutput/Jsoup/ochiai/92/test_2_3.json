    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and stack trace, the failure seems to be related to handling duplicate attributes in HTML parsing. The methods that are most likely involved in this process are those that deal with attributes and tags. \n\nGiven the context of the test, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:newAttribute()`** - This method is responsible for creating a new attribute, and it directly handles the logic for adding attributes to a tag. If there is an issue with how duplicate attributes are managed, this method would be a prime suspect.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:finaliseTag()`** - This method finalizes the tag and calls `newAttribute()`, which means it could also be involved in the handling of attributes.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:normalName()`** - This method returns the normalized name of the tag, which is relevant since the test case involves normalizing attribute names.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:appendAttributeName()`** - This method appends a new attribute name to the tag, which could be related to how duplicate attributes are processed.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:indexOfKey(Ljava/lang/String;)I`** - This method checks for the existence of a key in the attributes, which is crucial for identifying duplicates.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the updated ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 69,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test case regarding duplicate attributes in HTML parsing."
