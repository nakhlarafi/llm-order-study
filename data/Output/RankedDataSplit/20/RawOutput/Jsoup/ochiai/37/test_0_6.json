    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and the previously ranked methods, we can analyze the new coverage information to determine if any methods should be re-ranked or if the previous ranking remains valid.\n\nThe test `testNotPretty` is failing due to an assertion error related to the expected and actual HTML output. The relevant methods that are involved in generating the HTML output are primarily those that deal with the `html()` and `outerHtml()` methods, which are already ranked as the most suspicious.\n\nThe methods that are covered in the new test do not directly relate to the HTML generation process but rather involve token handling and parsing. However, since the failure is related to the output formatting, we should still consider the methods that are responsible for generating the HTML output.\n\nGiven that the previous ranking already identified the methods responsible for generating the HTML output, we will keep the previous ranking intact. The methods that are most suspicious remain the same, as they are directly involved in the output generation process.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 73,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 74,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
