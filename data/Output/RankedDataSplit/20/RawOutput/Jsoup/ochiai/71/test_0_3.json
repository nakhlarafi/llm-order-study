    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the covered methods, we can analyze the situation further. The test failure is due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse the query `p:matchText`. This indicates that the issue likely lies within the parsing logic of the selector, which is not directly related to the previously ranked methods.\n\nGiven the new information, we should consider the methods related to parsing and validation as more suspicious. The methods that are most relevant to the parsing of selectors are likely to be in the `QueryParser` class, which is not listed in the covered methods but is invoked in the stack trace. However, we can still rank the methods that are covered in the test.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new context:\n\n1. **Method Signature:** `org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList:noTracking()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`\n   - **Reason:** This method is related to error handling in parsing, which is directly relevant to the exception thrown.\n\n2. **Method Signature:** `org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings:normalizeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n   - **Reason:** This method normalizes tags, which could be relevant if the tag normalization is part of the selector parsing process.\n\n3. **Method Signature:** `org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings:normalizeAttributes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`\n   - **Reason:** Similar to the previous method, this could affect how attributes are handled in selectors.\n\n4. **Method Signature:** `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - **Reason:** This method validates that an object is not null, which is a common check that could be relevant in parsing logic.\n\n5. **Method Signature:** `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:isTrue(Z)V`\n   - **Reason:** This method checks if a condition is true, which could be used in various validation scenarios during parsing.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the parsing process and could potentially lead to the observed exception."
