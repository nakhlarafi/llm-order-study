    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their potential impact on the failure. The `NullPointerException` in the `Cleaner.copySafeNodes` method suggests that there may be an issue with how nodes are being processed or copied, particularly in relation to the `Whitelist` and the handling of framesets.\n\nGiven the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure. Here\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 170,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 172,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 173,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 174,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 170 (`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:<init>()V`)**: The constructor initializes the `Whitelist`, which is crucial for the `Cleaner` to determine what tags and attributes are safe. If this is not set up correctly, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n\n2. **Method ID 171 (`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:basic()Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`)**: This method creates a basic whitelist. If the whitelist is not properly configured, it could lead to issues when cleaning the document.\n\n3. **Method ID 172 (`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addTags([Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`)**: Adding tags to the whitelist is essential for the cleaning process. If tags are not added correctly, it could result in unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Method ID 173 (`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addEnforcedAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`)**: This method adds enforced attributes to the whitelist. If attributes are not enforced correctly, it could lead to a failure in the cleaning process.\n\n5. **Method ID 174 (`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`)**: Adding protocols is also important for ensuring that the cleaning process adheres to security standards. If protocols are not set, it could lead to unsafe behavior.\n\nThe previous methods related to `Node` and `Attributes` are less relevant in this context, as the failure seems to stem from the handling of the `Whitelist` and the cleaning process."
