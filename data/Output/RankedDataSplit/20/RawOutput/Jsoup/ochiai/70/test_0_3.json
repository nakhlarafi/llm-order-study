    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and the previously ranked methods, we can analyze the new coverage information to determine if any methods should be added to the ranking or if the existing ranking should be adjusted.\n\nThe test `testKeepsPreTextAtDepth` is failing due to an assertion error related to the expected and actual text output of a parsed HTML string. The methods that are covered in this test do not directly relate to the parsing logic that would affect the output of the `doc.text()` or `doc.body().html()` methods. \n\nThe previously ranked methods are more relevant to the parsing and formatting of HTML elements, particularly the handling of formatting elements and the stack of nodes. Given that the failure is related to the text output of a `<pre>` tag, which is likely affected by how the HTML is parsed and how whitespace is handled, the methods related to formatting and node management remain the most suspicious.\n\nSince the new methods covered do not seem to directly impact the parsing logic that would lead to the failure observed in the test, we will maintain the previous ranking.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
