    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, the failure seems to be related to whitespace handling in the `textarea` element. The expected output indicates that leading and trailing spaces should be dropped, while the actual output shows that they are preserved. This suggests that the methods responsible for handling whitespace are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new context, I will adjust the rankings to reflect the new information. The methods that are most likely to be involved in the whitespace handling are:\n\n1. **`preserveWhitespace()`** - This method determines whether whitespace should be preserved, which is directly related to the test case.\n2. **`appendNormalisedText(StringBuilder, TextNode)`** - This method normalizes whitespace, which is crucial for the expected behavior in the test.\n3. **`text(StringBuilder)`** - This method is responsible for constructing the text representation of the element, including handling whitespace.\n4. **`appendWhitespaceIfBr(Element, StringBuilder)`** - This method appends whitespace if the element is a `<br>`, which may indirectly affect whitespace handling in the context of the `textarea`.\n5. **`text()`** - This method calls `text(StringBuilder)` and is the public interface for getting the text, making it relevant to the test.\n\nThe methods from the previous ranking that are not directly related to whitespace handling will be deprioritized.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the whitespace handling issue highlighted by the failing test."
