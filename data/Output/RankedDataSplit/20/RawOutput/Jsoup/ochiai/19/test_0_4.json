    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, the failure seems to be related to the handling of custom protocols in the `Jsoup.clean` method. The test is asserting that certain attributes (specifically `src` attributes with custom protocols) are preserved in the output HTML. The failure indicates that the expected output is not matching the actual output, suggesting that the cleaning process is not correctly handling the custom protocols.\n\nGiven this context, we can analyze the previously ranked methods and the newly covered methods to determine the most suspicious ones. The methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure are those that deal with attributes and the cleaning process.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is directly responsible for cleaning the HTML and is the entry point for the test.\n2. **Rank 2**: `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` - This method is called within the `clean` method and is responsible for parsing the HTML body.\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic and may not be handling the attributes correctly.\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:get(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method retrieves attributes from the parsed document and is crucial for checking if the custom protocols are preserved.\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)V` - This method is responsible for adding attributes, which may be relevant if the attributes are not being added correctly during the cleaning process.\n\nHere\u2019s the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
