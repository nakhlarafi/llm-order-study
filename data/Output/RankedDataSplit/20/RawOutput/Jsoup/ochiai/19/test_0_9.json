    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, it appears that the test `handlesCustomProtocols` is failing due to an issue with the handling of custom protocols in the `Whitelist` class. The test is specifically checking if the `addProtocols` method is functioning correctly, which is not explicitly listed in the previous rankings. \n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, I will adjust the rankings to include the relevant methods that are likely contributing to the failure. The methods that are most suspicious based on the test failure and the coverage information are:\n\n1. **addProtocols** - This method is likely responsible for adding the custom protocols that the test is trying to validate.\n2. **isSafeAttribute** - This method checks if an attribute is safe, which is crucial for the test's success.\n3. **createSafeElement** - This method creates a safe element and checks attributes against the whitelist, which is also relevant to the test.\n4. **copySafeNodes** - This method is responsible for copying nodes and checking if they are safe, which is part of the cleaning process.\n5. **addEnforcedAttribute** - This method is involved in adding enforced attributes, which may also play a role in the test.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 169,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 172,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 188,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test based on the provided information."
