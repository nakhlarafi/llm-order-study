    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the previously ranked methods, we can analyze the new coverage information to determine if any methods should be added to the ranking or if the existing ranking should be adjusted.\n\nThe test `testBinaryThrowsExceptionWhenTypeIgnored` is primarily focused on handling binary data and ensuring that an exception is thrown when the content type is ignored. The stack trace indicates that an assertion failed, which suggests that the expected behavior (throwing an exception with a specific message) did not occur.\n\nThe covered methods from the new information are primarily related to the `Token` class and its various types (e.g., StartTag, EndTag, etc.). However, none of these methods directly relate to the parsing logic that would be involved in handling binary data or throwing exceptions based on content type.\n\nGiven that the previously ranked methods are more closely related to the parsing logic and state management, they remain relevant. The new methods covered do not seem to introduce any new suspicious behavior that would warrant a change in the ranking.\n\nThus, the previous ranking remains valid. Here is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
