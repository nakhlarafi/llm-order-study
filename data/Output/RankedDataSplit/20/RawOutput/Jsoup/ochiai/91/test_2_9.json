    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided coverage information and the previously ranked methods, I will analyze the new context and adjust the rankings accordingly. The test `testBinaryResultThrows` indicates that the method being tested is likely related to handling binary data, which may not be supported by the parsing methods.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods covered, the following adjustments to the rankings are made:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:parseInputStream` - This method is directly involved in parsing input streams, which is relevant to the test that checks for binary data handling.\n2. **Rank 2**: `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:readToByteBuffer` - This method reads data from an input stream into a byte buffer, which is also relevant to the handling of binary data.\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)` - This method is involved in selecting elements based on a CSS query, which may be indirectly related to the parsing process.\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.jsoup.nodes.Document$OutputSettings:charset()` - This method retrieves the charset settings for a document, which could be relevant if the binary data affects character encoding.\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer:normalize(Ljava/lang/String;)` - This method normalizes strings, which may be relevant in the context of parsing but is less directly related to the binary data handling.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 163,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 164,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 185,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 182,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 181,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
