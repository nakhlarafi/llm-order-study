    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods that are covered by the test and their relevance to the failure. The test is focused on retrieving sibling elements and their text content, which suggests that methods related to sibling navigation and child node management are particularly relevant.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new coverage information, we can adjust the ranking as follows:\n\n1. **nextSibling()** - This method is directly involved in retrieving the next sibling of a node, which is central to the test case.\n2. **childNode(int index)** - This method retrieves a child node at a specific index, which is relevant for navigating through siblings.\n3. **reparentChild(Node child)** - This method is involved in managing the parent-child relationship, which could affect sibling retrieval if not handled correctly.\n4. **appendChild(Node child)** - This method adds a child node and sets its sibling index, which is crucial for maintaining the correct order of siblings.\n5. **parentNode()** - This method retrieves the parent node, which is indirectly related but still relevant for understanding the structure of the node tree.\n\nThe methods that were previously ranked (4 and 5) are still relevant but less suspicious compared to the methods that directly deal with sibling navigation and child management.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 74,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
