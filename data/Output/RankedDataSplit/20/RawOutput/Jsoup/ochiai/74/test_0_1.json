    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the methods covered, I will analyze the new coverage data and adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods accordingly. The test failure indicates that the normalization of invisible characters in the text is not functioning as expected, which suggests that methods related to text processing and node insertion are likely to be more suspicious.\n\nHere are the top 5 most suspicious methods after considering the new coverage information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 20 (`insertNode`)**: This method is directly responsible for inserting nodes into the document structure, which is crucial for text normalization.\n2. **Method ID 21 (`pop`)**: This method removes the last element from the stack, which could affect how nodes are processed and inserted.\n3. **Method ID 22 (`inSpecificScope`)**: This method checks if a node is in a specific scope, which may influence how nodes are handled during parsing.\n4. **Method ID 23 (`inScope`)**: Similar to the previous method, this checks the scope of nodes, which is important for understanding how text is normalized.\n5. **Method ID 24 (`inButtonScope`)**: This method checks if a node is in a button scope, which could also affect how text is processed in certain contexts.\n\nThe previous rankings of methods related to `initialiseParse` and `parse` are still relevant but are now less suspicious compared to the methods directly involved in node insertion and scope management."
