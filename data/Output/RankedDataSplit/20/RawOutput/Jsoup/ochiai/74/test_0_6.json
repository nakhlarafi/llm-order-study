    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, it appears that the test `testNormalizesInvisiblesInText` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The method `text()` is responsible for normalizing the text, which includes handling invisible characters. Given that the test is specifically checking for the normalization of invisible characters, the methods involved in this process are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the methods based on the new information:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - **Method ID:** 87\n   - **Method Signature:** org.jsoup.nodes.Element:text()Ljava/lang/String;\n   - **Reason:** This method is directly responsible for returning the normalized text, and the test failure indicates that it is not handling invisible characters correctly.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - **Method ID:** 88\n   - **Method Signature:** org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendNormalisedText(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/TextNode;)V\n   - **Reason:** This method is called by `text()` to append normalized text, and it plays a crucial role in how text nodes are processed, including invisible characters.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - **Method ID:** 89\n   - **Method Signature:** org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Z\n   - **Reason:** This method determines whether whitespace should be preserved, which is relevant to the normalization process.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - **Method ID:** 86\n   - **Method Signature:** org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;\n   - **Reason:** While this method is less directly related to text normalization, it is involved in the structure of the document and could indirectly affect how text is processed.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - **Method ID:** 52\n   - **Method Signature:** org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V\n   - **Reason:** This method is less relevant to the specific issue of text normalization but is included as it may have some impact on the overall document structure.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
