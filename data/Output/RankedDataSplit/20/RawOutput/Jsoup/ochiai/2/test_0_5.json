    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and the previously ranked methods, we can analyze the situation further. The test `handlesTextAfterData` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The issue seems to be related to how text nodes are handled after data nodes (like `<script>` tags).\n\nGiven the context of the test and the stack trace, we can infer that the methods responsible for parsing and handling text and data nodes are likely to be the most suspicious. \n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 28 (`parseTextNode`)**: This method is directly responsible for creating text nodes, which is crucial in the context of the test that deals with text after a data node.\n2. **Method ID 42 (`parseStartTag`)**: This method handles the parsing of start tags, which is essential for understanding how elements like `<script>` are processed.\n3. **Method ID 103 (`isData`)**: This method checks if a tag is a data tag, which is relevant for determining how to handle text nodes that follow data nodes.\n4. **Method ID 81 (`normalise(Element)`)**: This method is involved in normalizing the document structure, which could affect how nodes are arranged and displayed.\n5. **Method ID 67 (`consumeWord`)**: This method is responsible for consuming words from the token queue, which may indirectly affect how text is parsed and handled.\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test based on their functionality and the context of the test case."
