    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, it appears that the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an unexpected result of `Infinity` when comparing the results of `FastMath.cosh(x)` and `Math.cosh(x)`. This suggests that the issue is likely related to the `cosh` method, which is already ranked as the most suspicious method.\n\nGiven that the test is specifically checking the behavior of `FastMath.cosh` and comparing it to the reference implementation, we should maintain the previous ranking while considering the context of the test. The `exp` method is also relevant since `cosh` relies on it for its calculations.\n\nHere is the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the continued suspicion of the `cosh` method due to the test failure, while also keeping the other methods in their previous ranks as they are still relevant to the calculations involved."
