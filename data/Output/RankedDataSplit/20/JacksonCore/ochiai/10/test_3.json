    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, the failure is related to the expected bucket count being 1024, but the actual bucket count returned was 2048. This indicates a potential issue with the `bucketCount()` method or the methods that influence the hash size and rehashing process.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new context, the following methods are most suspicious:\n\n1. **bucketCount()** - This method directly returns the `_hashSize`, which is the source of the failure.\n2. **rehash()** - This method modifies the `_hashSize` and is responsible for resizing the hash area, which could lead to the unexpected bucket count.\n3. **_calcOffset(int hash)** - This method calculates the offset based on the hash size, which could be indirectly related to how the bucket count is determined.\n4. **_verifySharing()** - This method checks if the hash area is shared and may trigger a rehash, affecting the bucket count.\n5. **<init>(ByteQuadsCanonicalizer, boolean, boolean, ByteQuadsCanonicalizer$TableInfo)** - The constructor initializes the `_hashSize`, which could also be a factor in the unexpected bucket count.\n\nThe previous ranking remains relevant, but we will adjust the ranks based on the new test context. Here is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
