    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the failing test, we can analyze the methods that were covered and their relevance to the failure. The test is failing because the expected bucket count is 16384, but the actual bucket count is 32768. This indicates a potential issue with how the hash size is being calculated or set.\n\nThe newly covered methods are:\n\n1. **nukeSymbols** - This method resets the symbol table, which could affect the count and size of the buckets.\n2. **_spilloverStart** - This method calculates the starting point for spillover, which is relevant for managing collisions.\n3. **_calcTertiaryShift** - This method calculates the tertiary shift based on the primary slots, which directly impacts how the hash table is structured.\n4. **TableInfo constructor** - This method initializes the table information, which could also affect the size and count of the buckets.\n5. **InternCache constructor** - This method initializes the intern cache, but it seems less relevant to the current issue.\n\nGiven the context of the test failure and the newly covered methods, we should adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the issue at hand. The methods that deal with the hash size and bucket calculations should be ranked higher.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **_calcTertiaryShift** (ID 22) is now ranked highest because it directly affects how the tertiary buckets are calculated, which is crucial for the bucket count.\n- **nukeSymbols** (ID 20) is ranked second as it resets the symbol table, which could lead to discrepancies in the expected counts.\n- **_spilloverStart** (ID 21) is ranked third since it relates to how spillover is managed, which is relevant to the bucket count.\n- The previously ranked methods that deal with rehashing and hash calculations remain in the top ranks but are adjusted based on the new context."
