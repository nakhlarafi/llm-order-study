    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the covered methods, we can analyze the situation further. The test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` that occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method. This indicates that the methods involved in the invocation handling and argument capturing are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new information, we can adjust the ranking to include the newly covered methods. The most suspicious methods are likely to be those that are directly involved in the invocation handling and stubbing process.\n\nHere is the updated ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 200,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `InvocationMatcher:matches` remains the most suspicious due to its direct involvement in matching invocations.\n- `MockHandlerImpl:handle` is still highly suspicious as it handles the invocation and could be the source of the exception.\n- `InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer` is also suspicious as it deals with adding answers to invocations.\n- The newly covered method `MockingProgressImpl:resetOngoingStubbing` is ranked next as it is related to resetting ongoing stubbing, which is relevant to the test case.\n- `MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance` remains in the ranking as it is part of the mock handling process. \n\nThe other methods covered in the new information do not seem to be directly related to the failure and thus are not included in the top 5."
