    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods that are covered by the test and their relevance to the failure. The failure indicates that the expected captured arguments do not match the actual captured arguments, which suggests that the issue likely lies in the argument capturing mechanism.\n\nGiven the previous ranking and the new coverage information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **ArgumentCaptor.capture()** - This method is directly involved in capturing the arguments passed to the mock, making it highly suspicious.\n2. **ArgumentsComparator.argumentsMatch(InvocationMatcher, Object[])** - This method checks if the arguments match the expected matchers, which is crucial for verifying the captured arguments.\n3. **ArgumentsComparator.argumentsMatch(InvocationMatcher, Invocation)** - Similar to the previous method, this one also deals with argument matching but in the context of an invocation.\n4. **InvocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()** - This method checks if there are answers for stubbing, which may indirectly affect how arguments are captured and verified.\n5. **NullResultGuardian.handle(Invocation)** - This method handles the invocation and may affect the return values, which could impact the argument capturing if the return type is not handled correctly.\n\nThe new methods covered by the test do not seem to directly relate to the failure, so they will not be included in the top 5 ranking.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 96,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
