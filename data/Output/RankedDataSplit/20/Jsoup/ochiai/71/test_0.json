    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided coverage information and the stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test fails due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse the query `p:matchText`. This indicates that the parsing logic is not handling this specific case correctly.\n\nGiven the context, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` - This method is directly responsible for parsing the query string, making it highly suspicious.\n   \n2. **Rank 2**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements()V` - This method is called during the parsing process and is responsible for finding elements based on the parsed query. It is also directly related to the failure.\n\n3. **Rank 3**: `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` - This method is part of the parsing process and is called by the `parse(String query)` method. It is relevant but less suspicious than the previous two.\n\n4. **Rank 4**: `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;` - This method is called to select elements based on the parsed query. It is indirectly related to the failure.\n\n5. **Rank 5**: `org.jsoup.select.Selector$SelectorParseException:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)V` - This method is the constructor for the exception thrown. While it is not the cause of the failure, it is relevant to the context of the error.\n\nNow, let's compile this ranking into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 161,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 163,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 162,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 158,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 178,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
