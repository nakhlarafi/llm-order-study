    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause the `IllegalArgumentException` that was thrown during the test execution.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 3** (`bracket`): Directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for determining the bounds for the root-finding function, which is critical for the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n2. **Method ID 4** (`bracket`): Also involved in the bracket method, which is crucial for finding the roots and could lead to invalid parameters.\n3. **Method ID 15** (`inverseCumulativeProbability`): This method is directly called in the stack trace and is responsible for handling the probability input, which could lead to invalid bounds.\n4. **Method ID 2** (`inverseCumulativeProbability`): This method is called within the `FDistributionImpl` class and is critical for the functionality being tested.\n5. **Method ID 1** (`getInitialDomain`): This method is used to get the initial domain for the probability, which could affect the bounds.\n6. **Method ID 20** (`getDomainLowerBound`): This method returns the lower bound for the domain, which is directly related to the exception thrown.\n7. **Method ID 5** (`getDomainUpperBound`): This method returns the upper bound for the domain, which is also related to the exception.\n8. **Method ID 6** (`FDistributionImpl` constructor): This method initializes the distribution and sets degrees of freedom, which could lead to invalid states if not set correctly.\n9. **Method ID 17** (`setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom`): This method sets the numerator degrees of freedom, which is part of the distribution's state.\n10. **Method ID 0** (`regularizedBeta`): While it is part of the calculations, it is less directly involved in the exception compared to the others."
