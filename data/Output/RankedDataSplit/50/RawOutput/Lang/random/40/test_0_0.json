    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and the methods covered, we can analyze the situation as follows:\n\n1. The test `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` is designed to check the behavior of the `containsIgnoreCase` method in the `StringUtils` class, particularly with respect to locale independence.\n2. The failure occurs when the test attempts to assert that the string \"\u00df\" does not contain \"SS\" when the locale is set to English. This indicates that there is a potential issue with how the `containsIgnoreCase` method handles certain characters in different locales.\n3. The `containsIgnoreCase` method calls the `contains` method when either of the strings is null, which is not the case here, so the focus should be primarily on the `containsIgnoreCase` method.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failing test:\n\n1. **containsIgnoreCase** - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the failure occurs.\n2. **contains** - This method is called by `containsIgnoreCase` and is indirectly related to the failure, as it handles the actual string comparison.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
