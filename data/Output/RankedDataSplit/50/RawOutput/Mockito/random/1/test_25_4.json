    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods that were covered during the test execution. The test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` encountered an `UnsupportedOperationException`, which indicates that there may be an issue with how the stubbing is being handled in the mocked object.\n\nThe methods that were covered during this test do not directly relate to the previously ranked methods, but they do provide additional context for understanding the behavior of the mocking framework. The methods that were covered are related to mock settings and default values, which may not directly impact the failure observed in the stack trace.\n\nGiven that the original ranking was based on the suspicion of methods related to invocation handling and stubbing, we should consider the implications of the new test coverage. The methods that were previously ranked remain relevant, as they are still involved in the invocation and stubbing processes.\n\nHowever, since the new test coverage does not introduce any new failures or directly impact the previously ranked methods, we can retain the original ranking without any changes.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 170,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 196,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 151,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
