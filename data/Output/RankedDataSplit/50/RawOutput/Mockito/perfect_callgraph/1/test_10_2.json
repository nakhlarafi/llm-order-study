    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are most suspicious in relation to the failing test. The test indicates that there is an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurring in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which suggests that the `InvocationMatcher` class is likely involved in the issue.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher** is directly implicated in the stack trace, so it should be ranked highest.\n2. **InvocationContainerImpl** is also relevant as it interacts with the `InvocationMatcher`.\n3. **MatchersBinder** is involved in binding matchers to invocations, which is crucial for the test case.\n4. **ReturnsEmptyValues** and **ConsecutiveStubbing** are less directly related but still part of the stubbing process.\n5. The remaining methods are less relevant to the specific failure.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new observations:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 99,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 148,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the failure observed in the test case, with the most suspicious methods at the top."
