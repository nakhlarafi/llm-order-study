    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are now covered and their relevance to the failing test. The test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which indicates that the issue is likely related to how arguments are being captured or processed during the stubbing reset.\n\nGiven this context, we can adjust the ranking of the previously identified suspicious methods. The methods that are directly related to the invocation handling and argument capturing will be prioritized.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new observations:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 148,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 69,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **InvocationMatcher (ID 3)** and **MatchersBinder (ID 72)** remain at the top due to their direct involvement in the invocation matching process.\n2. **MockHandlerImpl.handle (ID 148)** is now ranked third as it is directly involved in handling invocations and could be a source of the exception.\n3. The other methods related to stubbing and invocation handling remain in the ranking, but their positions have been adjusted based on the new context provided by the test failure and the stack trace.\n4. **InvocationContainerImpl.hasInvocationForPotentialStubbing (ID 100)** is added to the ranking as it is relevant to the invocation handling process, especially in the context of resetting stubbings. \n\nThis updated ranking reflects the latest observations and the context of the failing test."
