    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and stack trace, we will analyze the methods that are covered by the test and their relevance to the functionality being tested. The test is focused on parsing HTML and handling text nodes, particularly after a `<script>` tag.\n\nHere are the top 10 most suspicious methods ranked based on their potential involvement in the failure of the test:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 14 (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseTextNode`)**: This method is directly responsible for parsing text nodes, which is crucial for the test that checks text after a `<script>` tag.\n2. **Method ID 13 (`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeTo`)**: This method consumes characters until a specified sequence is found, which is essential for parsing text correctly.\n3. **Method ID 3 (`org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode:getWholeText`)**: This method retrieves the whole text of a text node, which is directly related to the output being tested.\n4. **Method ID 36 (`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise`)**: This method normalizes the document structure, which could affect how text nodes are handled.\n5. **Method ID 7 (`org.jsoup.select.Collector:collect`)**: This method collects elements based on evaluators, which may influence how elements are processed in the document.\n6. **Method ID 22 (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose`)**: This method manages the stack of elements, which is important for ensuring the correct structure of the parsed document.\n7. **Method ID 39 (`org.jsoup.parser.Tag:canContain`)**: This method checks if a tag can contain another tag, which is relevant for parsing nested structures.\n8. **Method ID 1 (`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select`)**: This method selects elements based on a query, which may indirectly affect how text nodes are processed.\n9. **Method ID 4 (`org.jsoup.parser.Tag:setOptionalClosing`)**: This method sets whether a tag can be closed optionally, which could affect parsing behavior.\n10. **Method ID 5 (`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace`)**: This method checks if whitespace should be preserved, which is relevant for text handling in HTML.\n\nThese rankings are based on the methods' direct involvement in parsing and handling text nodes, which are critical to the functionality being tested."
