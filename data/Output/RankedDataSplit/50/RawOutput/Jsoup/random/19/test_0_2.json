    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing tests and their relevance to the previously ranked methods. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` specifically interacts with the `Whitelist` class, which is responsible for managing safe tags and attributes, including protocols.\n\nGiven that the test is focused on the `Whitelist` and its methods, we should adjust the ranking of the methods accordingly. The methods related to `Whitelist` are particularly relevant, and we should consider their importance in the context of the test.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`\n   - Method ID: 138\n   - Reason: This method is directly involved in adding protocols to the whitelist, which is crucial for the test that checks if custom protocols are handled correctly.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`\n   - Method ID: 51\n   - Reason: This method checks if a tag is safe, which is relevant to the test's validation of safe tags.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:basicWithImages()Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`\n   - Method ID: 145\n   - Reason: This method creates a basic whitelist with images, which is used in the test.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Cleaner$ElementMeta;`\n   - Method ID: 107\n   - Reason: This method is responsible for creating safe elements based on the whitelist, which is relevant to the cleaning process in the test.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilderState$24:<clinit>()V`\n   - Method ID: 90\n   - Reason: This method is still suspicious as it processes tokens, which may indirectly relate to the handling of tags and attributes.\n\n6. **Rank: 6**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:size()I`\n   - Method ID: 50\n   - Reason: This method checks the size of attributes, which could be relevant in the context of the attributes being processed.\n\n7. **Rank: 7**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.nodes.Node:attr(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n   - Method ID: 60\n   - Reason: This method retrieves an attribute value, which is relevant when checking for safe attributes.\n\n8. **Rank: 8**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`\n   - Method ID: 55\n   - Reason: This method processes tokens, which is relevant to the overall parsing and cleaning process.\n\n9. **Rank: 9**\n   - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.nodes.Node:ownerDocument()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - Method ID: 72\n   - Reason: This method retrieves the owner document, which may be relevant in the context of node relationships.\n\n10. **Rank: 10**\n    - Method Signature: `org.jsoup.parser.Tag:isKnownTag()Z`\n    - Method ID: 9\n    - Reason: This method checks if a tag is known, which is relevant for the overall tag handling.\n\nHere is the final ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 138,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 145,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 55,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
