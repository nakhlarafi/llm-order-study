    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the new test case on the existing ranking of the methods. The test case `testChainedRemoveAttributes` indicates that the `removeAttr` method is being called multiple times on an `Element`, which suggests that methods related to attribute removal and element manipulation are now more relevant.\n\nThe newly covered method `org.jsoup.nodes.BooleanAttribute:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` is also relevant, as it is likely involved in the attribute handling process. However, since it is a constructor and does not directly relate to the logic of removing attributes, it may not be as suspicious as the methods that are directly involved in the attribute removal process.\n\nGiven this context, we should adjust the ranking to reflect the increased suspicion around methods related to attribute removal. The `removeIgnoreCase` method remains highly suspicious as it is directly involved in the removal of attributes. The `Element` constructor methods are also relevant since they set up the attributes for the elements.\n\nHere is the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 200,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the `BooleanAttribute` constructor is now ranked 5th, reflecting its relevance to the attribute handling process, while the other methods retain their previous ranks as they are still considered suspicious based on the context of the tests."
