    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we need to analyze the newly covered methods and their relevance to the previously ranked methods. The new methods covered do not directly relate to the previously ranked methods, but they do provide insight into the overall structure and functionality of the `Jsoup` library.\n\nThe previously ranked methods remain relevant, but we should consider the new methods and their potential impact on the existing ranking. The new methods do not seem to indicate any direct issues with the previously ranked methods, but they do suggest that the `Elements` constructor and the `normalise` method are still critical areas to investigate, especially since the test is focused on parsing and normalizing HTML.\n\nGiven that the test is about creating a structure from a body snippet and normalizing it, the methods related to `TextNode` and `Element` are still of interest, but the new methods do not change the suspicion level of the previously ranked methods.\n\nThus, the final ranking remains the same, as the new methods do not introduce any new suspicions or issues with the existing methods.\n\nHere is the final ranking in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 79,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 96,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
