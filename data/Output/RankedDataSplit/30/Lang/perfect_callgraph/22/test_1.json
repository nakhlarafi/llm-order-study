    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and covered methods, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious. The test is failing due to an assertion that expected a different value than what was returned, specifically related to the `getReducedFraction` method. \n\nThe most suspicious methods are likely those that are directly involved in the computation of the fraction reduction, particularly the `getReducedFraction` method itself and the `greatestCommonDivisor` method, as they are critical to the logic being tested. The constructor and the getter methods are less likely to be the source of the issue since they are primarily for data retrieval and object instantiation.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **getReducedFraction (ID: 1)**: This method is the primary focus of the test and is directly responsible for returning the reduced fraction. Any issues in its logic would directly affect the test outcome.\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor (ID: 0)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to compute the GCD, which is essential for reducing the fraction. If there is a bug in this method, it would also lead to incorrect results.\n3. **getDenominator (ID: 2)**: This method retrieves the denominator of the fraction. While it is less likely to be the source of the issue, it is still involved in the final output.\n4. **getNumerator (ID: 3)**: Similar to `getDenominator`, this method retrieves the numerator. It is also less likely to be the source of the issue but is still relevant.\n5. **Constructor (ID: 4)**: The constructor initializes the fraction object. While it is essential for creating the object, it is less likely to be the cause of the test failure compared to the methods that perform calculations. \n\nThe remaining methods are not included in the ranking as they are not directly involved in the logic being tested."
