    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods involved in the failing test. The `OutOfMemoryError` indicates that there is likely an issue with memory allocation, which can often be traced back to methods that handle string manipulation or large data structures.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`appendQuotedString`**: This method is directly involved in appending strings and is likely to be the source of excessive memory usage, especially if it is called in a loop or with large inputs.\n2. **`applyPattern`**: This method is responsible for applying the pattern and contains a loop that processes the input string. It also calls `appendQuotedString`, making it a strong candidate for causing memory issues.\n3. **Constructors of `ExtendedMessageFormat`**: Both constructors are involved in initializing the object and calling `applyPattern`, which means they could also contribute to the memory issue indirectly.\n4. **`next`**: This method is relatively simple and just increments an index, so it is less suspicious compared to the others.\n\nGiven this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The methods are ranked based on their potential to cause memory issues, with `appendQuotedString` and `applyPattern` being the most suspicious due to their direct involvement in string manipulation and looping constructs. The constructors are also suspicious but to a lesser extent. The `next` method is the least suspicious as it performs a simple operation."
