    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the context of the error and the methods involved in the stack trace.\n\nThe error message indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid endpoint parameters in the `bracket` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`. This suggests that the parameters being passed to this method are not valid, which could be due to incorrect values being calculated or passed from the methods leading up to it.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 13)** - This method is directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for calling the `bracket` method. It is highly suspicious as it is the entry point for the error.\n  \n2. **`AbstractContinuousDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 14)** - This method is also directly involved in the stack trace and calls the `bracket` method. It is suspicious as it handles the input for the `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n\n3. **`bracket` (Method ID: 15)** - This method is where the exception is thrown. It is directly responsible for the error, making it very suspicious.\n\n4. **`getDomainLowerBound` (Method ID: 21)** - This method returns a lower bound of 0.0, which is used in the `bracket` method. If the logic leading to this value is incorrect, it could lead to the exception.\n\n5. **`getDomainUpperBound` (Method ID: 18)** - This method returns `Double.MAX_VALUE`, which is also used in the `bracket` method. If the upper bound is not set correctly, it could contribute to the invalid parameters.\n\n6. **`getInitialDomain` (Method ID: 0)** - This method is involved in calculating the initial domain for the distribution. If it returns an incorrect value, it could affect the parameters passed to the `bracket` method.\n\n7. **`setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 5)** - This method sets the denominator degrees of freedom. If it is not set correctly, it could lead to invalid calculations in the distribution methods.\n\n8. **`setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` (Method ID: 4)** - Similar to the previous method, if the numerator degrees of freedom is not set correctly, it could lead to issues in the calculations.\n\n9. **`cumulativeProbability` (Method ID: 6)** - This method is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, which is a part of the distribution logic. If it returns an incorrect value, it could affect the subsequent calculations.\n\n10. **`regularizedBeta` (Method ID: 7)** - This method is part of the calculations for the cumulative probability. If it has issues, it could propagate errors through the calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
