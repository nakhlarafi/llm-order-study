    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing tests and adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods accordingly. The test `handlesDataOnlyTags` specifically interacts with the `style` and `script` tags, which are relevant to the methods in the `TreeBuilder` class.\n\n### Analysis of Covered Methods:\n1. The test checks the behavior of the `style` tag, which is directly related to the `insert(Token.Character characterToken)` method (Rank 1) since it handles character tokens that may be part of a `style` tag.\n2. The test also checks the `script` tag, which is also relevant to the same method (Rank 1) as it deals with character tokens within a `script` tag.\n3. The `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` method (Rank 2) is also relevant since it handles the insertion of start tags, including `script` and `style`.\n4. The `insert(String startTagName)` method (Rank 3) is relevant as it deals with inserting elements by their tag name, which could include `style` and `script`.\n5. The `insert(Element el)` method (Rank 4) is relevant as it handles the insertion of elements into the tree structure.\n\n### Adjusted Ranking:\nGiven the new information, we can adjust the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the test cases that were executed:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `insert(Token.Character characterToken)` - Most suspicious due to its direct handling of character data in `style` and `script` tags.\n2. **Rank 2**: `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` - Suspicious as it handles the insertion of start tags, including `style` and `script`.\n3. **Rank 3**: `insert(String startTagName)` - Relevant for inserting elements by tag name, including `style` and `script`.\n4. **Rank 4**: `insert(Element el)` - Important for the overall insertion logic of elements.\n5. **Rank 5**: `pushActiveFormattingElements(Element in)` - Less relevant but still part of the tree manipulation.\n6. **Rank 6**: `error(TreeBuilderState state)` - Not directly related to the test but could be involved in error handling.\n7. **Rank 7**: `isElementInQueue(DescendableLinkedList<Element> queue, Element element)` - Less relevant but still part of the tree structure.\n8. **Rank 8**: `onStack(Element el)` - Related to checking if an element is on the stack.\n9. **Rank 9**: `getStack()` - Provides access to the stack but is less suspicious.\n10. **Rank 10**: `Document.<init>(String baseUri)` - Least suspicious as it is related to document initialization.\n\n### Final Ranking in JSON Format:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
