    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the failing test and the method it covers. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsNone` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The failure indicates that the method is returning `false` when it should return `true`, suggesting a potential issue in the implementation of `containsNone`.\n\nGiven that the test is focused on the `containsNone` method and the stack trace points directly to it, we can rank this method as the most suspicious. However, we also need to consider other methods that might be indirectly related or could affect the behavior of `containsNone`.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- Method ID `0` (the `containsNone` method) is ranked the highest due to the direct failure in the test.\n- The other methods (IDs 1-9) are placeholders for other methods that could be related but are not directly implicated in the failure. They are ranked lower as they are less likely to be the source of the issue based on the provided information. \n\nNote: The actual IDs for methods 1-9 would depend on the specific implementation and context of the `StringUtils` class, which is not provided here."
