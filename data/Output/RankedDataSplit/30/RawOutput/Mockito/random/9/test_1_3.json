    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are involved in the failure of the test `abstractMethodStubbed`. The key issue is that the test attempts to call a real method on a mock of an abstract class, which is not allowed in Mockito. This leads us to focus on the methods that are directly related to this behavior.\n\nThe most suspicious methods based on the stack trace and the context of the test are:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()`** - This method is directly involved in the error message indicating that calling a real method on an abstract class is not allowed. It is the first method that should be ranked highest in suspicion.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian:handle(...)`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and is part of the chain that leads to the exception being thrown when trying to call the real method.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(...)`** - This method also plays a role in handling the invocation and notifying about the method call, making it relevant to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`** - This method is directly invoked when the exception is thrown, indicating that it is also highly relevant to the failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(...)`** - This method is part of the mock handling process and is involved in the invocation chain leading to the exception.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can update the ranking of the methods as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking, the methods that are directly involved in the failure of the test have been prioritized, while the previously ranked methods have been adjusted accordingly."
