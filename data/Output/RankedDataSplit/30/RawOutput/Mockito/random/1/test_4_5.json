    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `shouldNotThrowAnyException`. The stack trace indicates that the `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is not in the previously ranked methods. However, the methods that are involved in the stack trace and are already ranked should be re-evaluated based on their relevance to the failure.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to the failure are:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher**: This is directly involved in capturing arguments and is likely to be a significant factor in the failure.\n2. **InvocationNotifierHandler**: This method is also involved in handling the invocation and notifying the method call, which is part of the stack trace.\n3. **InvocationContainerImpl**: This class is involved in managing the invocation and stubbing, which is relevant to the test case.\n\nGiven this context, we will adjust the ranking of the methods based on their involvement in the failure and the new information provided.\n\nHere is the updated ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 128,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 99,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 137,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 151,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **InvocationMatcher (ID: 128)** is now ranked highest due to its direct involvement in capturing arguments, which is critical to the test failure.\n- **InvocationNotifierHandler (ID: 94)** remains high due to its role in handling invocations.\n- **InvocationContainerImpl (ID: 99)** is also retained in the top ranks as it manages stubbing and invocation.\n- The other methods retain their positions as they are still relevant but less directly involved in the failure. \n- **InvocationMatcher:getInvocation (ID: 151)** is added to the top 10 due to its relevance in the stack trace, indicating it may also be a contributing factor to the failure."
