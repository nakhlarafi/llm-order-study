    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are now covered and their relevance to the failing test. The test `test_stub_only_not_verifiable` indicates that there is an issue with the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is likely related to the `InvocationMatcher` constructor.\n\nGiven that the stack trace points to `InvocationMatcher` and the test is about stubbing behavior, we should adjust the rankings accordingly. The methods that are directly involved in the stubbing process and argument matching are now more suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 58,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **InvocationMatcher Constructor** remains the most suspicious as it is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **findAnswerFor** method (ID 36) is now ranked higher because it is responsible for finding the correct answer for a given invocation, which is crucial in the context of stubbing.\n3. The `when` methods (IDs 1 and 2) are still suspicious but have been moved down as the focus shifts to the invocation handling.\n4. The `stubOnly` method (ID 58) is added to the ranking as it is directly related to the test case that is failing, indicating that the stub-only behavior is not being handled correctly.\n5. Other methods related to mock verification and argument matching are adjusted accordingly based on their relevance to the test case. \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the methods that are most likely contributing to the failure of the test."
