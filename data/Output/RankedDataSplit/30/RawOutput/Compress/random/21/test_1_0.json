The ranking is based on the likelihood that a failure in the test could be traced back to issues in these methods, considering their relevance to the functionality being tested.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking considers the methods that are directly involved in writing and managing the output file, as these are likely to be the source of issues when compressing files, especially when some files are not empty."
