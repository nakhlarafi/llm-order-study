    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were covered by the failing tests and adjust the ranking of the most suspicious methods accordingly. The new methods covered are primarily related to the `TokenQueue`, `Evaluator`, and `Collector` classes, which are not directly related to the previously identified suspicious methods in the `HtmlTreeBuilder` and `TextNode` classes.\n\nGiven that the failing tests are focused on class name matching and case insensitivity, it suggests that the methods related to parsing and evaluating elements may be more relevant. However, since the previously identified methods are still related to the core functionality of the HTML parsing and tree building, we will adjust the ranking based on the new coverage information.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 157,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 180,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 181,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The top 8 methods remain unchanged as they are still the most suspicious based on the previous analysis.\n- The new methods from the `TokenQueue` class (IDs 180 and 181) are added to the bottom of the ranking, as they are now relevant due to the new test coverage, but they are less suspicious compared to the methods in `HtmlTreeBuilder` and `TextNode` that directly deal with the structure and content of the HTML being parsed."
