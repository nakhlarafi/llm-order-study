    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were previously ranked and see if any adjustments are warranted. The test `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest.testNotPretty` primarily interacts with the `Document` and `Element` classes, but it does not directly invoke any of the methods in the `HtmlTreeBuilder` class that were previously ranked.\n\nSince the test does not provide new coverage for the methods in `HtmlTreeBuilder`, we will retain the previous rankings as they are based on the existing coverage and stack trace information. \n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nNo changes were made to the rankings as the new test coverage did not affect the previously identified suspicious methods."
