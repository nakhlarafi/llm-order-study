    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the failing test. The test is focused on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method, which is responsible for extracting and validating character sets from content type strings. \n\nThe methods involved are:\n\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)` - This method is directly tested and is the primary suspect since the test is failing on its assertions.\n2. `<clinit>()` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. While it is not directly tested, any issues with the pattern could affect the behavior of `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)` - Most suspicious as it is the method being tested and is directly responsible for the output.\n2. `<clinit>()` - Less suspicious than the method being tested, but still relevant since it initializes the pattern used in the method.\n\nSince there are only two methods involved, we will rank them accordingly. Here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
