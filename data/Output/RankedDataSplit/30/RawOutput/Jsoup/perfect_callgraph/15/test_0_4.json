    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information provided, we can analyze the methods that were previously ranked and see if any adjustments are warranted. The test `handlesDataOnlyTags` focuses on parsing HTML content, particularly handling `<style>` and `<script>` tags, which suggests that methods related to tag handling and node insertion are particularly relevant.\n\n### Analysis of Covered Methods\n1. **Methods related to `Token` and `Tokeniser`**: The covered methods are primarily from the `Tokeniser` class, which is responsible for parsing tokens from the input HTML. This indicates that the parsing logic is being exercised, which may indirectly affect the methods in the `TreeBuilder` class.\n\n2. **Methods in `TreeBuilder`**: The methods that were previously ranked are still relevant, especially those that handle the insertion of nodes and elements, as they are likely to be called during the parsing process.\n\n### Updated Ranking\nGiven the focus of the test on handling data-only tags and the fact that the `Tokeniser` methods are covered, we should adjust the ranking of the `TreeBuilder` methods based on their relevance to the parsing process and the specific tags being tested.\n\n1. **Rank 1**: `insert(Token.Character characterToken)` - This method is still the most suspicious as it directly handles character tokens, which are crucial for the `<style>` and `<script>` tags.\n2. **Rank 2**: `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` - This method is important for handling start tags, which are essential for parsing the `<style>` and `<script>` tags.\n3. **Rank 3**: `insert(String startTagName)` - Similar to the above, this method handles string-based start tags.\n4. **Rank 4**: `insert(Element el)` - This method is responsible for inserting elements into the tree, which is critical during parsing.\n5. **Rank 5**: `pushActiveFormattingElements(Element in)` - This method may be relevant if the test involves active formatting elements, but it is less directly related to the specific tags being tested.\n6. **Rank 6**: `error(TreeBuilderState state)` - This method is less suspicious but could be relevant if errors occur during parsing.\n7. **Rank 7**: `isElementInQueue(DescendableLinkedList<Element> queue, Element element)` - This method checks if an element is in the queue, which may not be directly relevant to the current test.\n8. **Rank 8**: `onStack(Element el)` - Similar to the above, this checks if an element is on the stack.\n9. **Rank 9**: `getStack()` - This method retrieves the stack but does not directly affect parsing.\n10. **Rank 10**: `Document.<init>(String baseUri)` - This constructor is less relevant to the parsing logic being tested.\n\n### Final Ranking in JSON Format\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the latest observations and the relevance of each method to the test case provided."
