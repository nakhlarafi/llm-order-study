    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their relevance to the failing test case, which involves parsing a selector with a single quote in a `:contains` expression.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 7 (`contains`)**: Directly related to the `:contains` functionality, which is the focus of the test.\n2. **Method ID 28 (`parse`)**: This method is responsible for parsing the entire query, including the `:contains` part.\n3. **Method ID 12 (`findElements`)**: This method is called during parsing and may handle the `:contains` selector.\n4. **Method ID 3 (`consumeElementSelector`)**: This method is involved in consuming element selectors, which may include the `:contains` syntax.\n5. **Method ID 1 (`matchesAny`)**: This method checks if any of the provided sequences match, which could be relevant in parsing.\n6. **Method ID 0 (`matches`)**: Similar to `matchesAny`, it checks for matches in the token queue.\n7. **Method ID 4 (`byTag`)**: While not directly related to `:contains`, it is part of the parsing logic.\n8. **Method ID 2 (`byTag`)**: Related to tag parsing, which may indirectly affect how selectors are processed.\n9. **Method ID 8 (`consume`)**: This method consumes a sequence from the token queue, which is part of the parsing process.\n10. **Method ID 6 (`Evaluator$Tag`)**: This is an abstract class for tag evaluation, which may be involved in the evaluation process but is less directly related to the failing test."
