    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can analyze the impact of the new test results on the previously ranked methods. The test `org.jsoup.safety.CleanerTest.testIsValid` primarily interacts with the `Jsoup.isValid` method, which is ranked 3 in the previous list. This method is responsible for validating HTML against a given whitelist, and it calls the `Cleaner.isValid` method, which is likely to involve the `copySafeNodes` method (ranked 4) as part of its operation.\n\nGiven that the test covers the `isValid` method and indirectly tests the `copySafeNodes` method, we can infer that these methods are more relevant to the failing tests. The `isSafeTag` method (ranked 1) is also crucial since it checks if a tag is safe, which is fundamental to the validation process.\n\nThe new coverage information does not introduce any new failures or issues with the previously ranked methods, but it reinforces the importance of the methods involved in the validation process. Therefore, we will adjust the ranking slightly to reflect the increased relevance of the `isValid` and `copySafeNodes` methods.\n\nHere is the updated ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 114,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this updated ranking:\n- `Jsoup.isValid` (ID 114) is now ranked 1 due to its direct involvement in the test.\n- `Cleaner.copySafeNodes` (ID 102) is ranked 2 for its role in processing safe nodes during validation.\n- `Whitelist.isSafeTag` (ID 63) is now ranked 3, as it is still critical for determining tag safety.\n- The remaining methods retain their previous ranks, as they are less directly impacted by the new test coverage."
